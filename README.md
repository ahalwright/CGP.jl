CGP.jl is a library for using Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) and linear genetic programming (LGP) in Julia. 
It was originally developed for GGP only by George Lesica and Alden Wright.  It is now (as of June 2022)
under further development by Alden Wright to support research on evolution by Alden Wright (alden.wright@umontana.edu) 
and Cheyenne Laue.  It is no longer being developed as a general CGP libary and includes many functions relative only
to this research.

The premise of this research is that the digital logic gate circuit genotype-phenotype map is an excellent testbed
for understanding the role of genotype-phenotype maps in evolution.  For more explanation, see
Wright, A. H., & Laue, C. L. (2021). Evolvability and complexity properties of the digital circuit genotype-phenotype map.
