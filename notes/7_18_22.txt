Assignment for Cooper.

Part 1:  If you haven't already done so, create your own code and notes directories by cloning
   git@github.com:ahalwright/CGP.jl.git  or  https://github.com/ahalwright/CGP.jl

Part 2:  This is relative to the plot  data/2020/11_11/kolmogorov_vs_tononi_complexity_8lb.png 
   and the code of run_kolmogorov_complexity() which starts at line 441 Complexity.jl.
   Configuration files are in data/2020/11_11/ and data/7_2_21/

1.  cp  ../../cgp.jl/data/7_2_21/run_k_complexityA.jl into data/7_18_22/ on gps, make appropriate modifications, and run it with 4 processes.
2.  Copy data/7_2_21/run_k_complexityC.jl into data/7_18_22/ on fluda, make appropriate modifications, and run it with 24 processes.
3.  Regenerate the plot listed above following the procedure in  notes/2_1.txt
4.  Note that Tononi complexity generated by run_kolmogorov_complexity() is based on the minimum complexity genotype found.
    Question:  Supposed Tononi complexity is generated with fixed parameters.  How does this change the plot.
    The phenotypes used to generate the plot are in data/2020/11_11/run_k_complexityD.jl
    Compute or find the the Tononi complexity of these phenotypes with parameters 4x1 11 gates 8 levelsback.
    The function pheno_evolve() in Evolve.jl may be helpful.  The function complexity5() in InfTheory.jl computes Tononi complexity.
    Then regenerate the plot using these complexities.
