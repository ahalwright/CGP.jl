Revised mutational_evolvability.jl to compute number of unique phenotypes
in mutational neighborhoods of a given goals of increasing size.
Also saves Tononi complexity and robustness of the circuit that is evolved
to map to the given goal.  If no circuit is found that maps to the given goal,
then the goal is replaced by a random goal.  This allows numgates to be set
so that some goals have K complexity less than numgates.

numinteriors (numgates) and levelsback must be kept small or memory will overflow.

Successful runs in data/2_12 for all 3x1 goals with 7 gates, 4 levelsback (F)
and with 7 gates 5 levelsback (H).
