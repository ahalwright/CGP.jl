Wrote extract_component_sizes() and add_component_sizes_to_df() in neutral_walk.jl 
to extract info in _ints.txt files in 1_13 and 1_15 and add it to the corresponding csv file.

csvfile = "../data/1_13/neutral_walks1_13N.csv"
add_component_sizes_to_df(csvfile)
Did not actually add data to csv files except in this one case.
