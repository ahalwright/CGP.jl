Approximately 5/18:  Found bug in mut_evolve() or mutate_chromsome!().  
Wrote test/test_mutate.jl in to test.  Works now.

5_12:  Rerun with mutate_chromsome!() fixed on 5/29.
See compare_reduce_numactive_k_complexity5_12B.xlsx  for summary of comparison
k_complexity definitely better.  Data still in 5_12.
5_15:  Rerun with mutate_chromsome!() fixed on 5/29.
5_16:  Rerun with mutate_chromsome!() fixed on 5/29.
