Complexity is information.

Information must be about something.  Refer to Adami's definition of complexity.

The complexity of an entity (organism, ecology, technological artifact, economy, species, etc) 
is the amount of information that must be transmitted through time to maintain the entity
through time.  Evolution is enhanced by complexity.

The most crucial property of life is its ability to encode the information of organisms in
a separate physical medium (mostly DNA).  See the Davies book.  The software and hardware
of life.

This suggests a synthetic biology approach to understanding the origin of life.  
Try to construct the simplest living organism based on DNA or RNA and proteins.

Or in artificial life:  try to construct the simplest "universal constructor"
as defined by von Neuman --- see the Davies book.  Is a univeral Turing machine
a universal constructor?

Important events in the history of the evolution of complexity:
1.  The origin continuing evolution by natural selection.
2.  The origin of life which encodes its information.
3.  The evolution of cooperation such as microfilms.
4.  Eukaryotes and their more complex representation of information with nucliei
5.  Multicellularity.
6.  Nervous systems.
7.  Technology.  Or maybe niche construction.  
8.  Transmission of technological information through time.  Relationship to cummulative cultural evolution.
9.  Human spoken language.  Related to human cultural cooperation.
10.  Human written language.
11.  Printing.
12.  Science.

The evolution of complexity is enabled by the existence of increasingly complex adaptations---a property of nature.

Information is always about something.
