Complexity null model:

Start with a G-P map where each phenotype has a frequency and a K complexity.
For the null model, assign the K complexity to phenotypes randomly.

We have a plot of K complexity vs. log freq for 10 and 12 gates:
scatter(lgfreq5,kc5,smooth=true,labels="10 gates 5 levelsback",markershape=:dtriangle)
scatter!(lgfreq6,kc6,smooth=true,labels="12 gates 6 levelsback",markershape=:utriangle)
scatter!(-lgfreq6.-findmax(kc6)[1],freq6*findmax(kc6)[1]/findmax(freq6)[1],labels="null model")
scatter!(legend=:topright,ylabel="K complexity",xlabel="log frequency")
