Trying to read "Algorithmically probable mutations reproduce aspects of evolution, such as convergence rate, genetic memory and modularity"
by Hern{\'a}ndez-Orozco, Santiago and Kiani, Narsis A and Zenil, Hector 2018.  I think the idea is that one should choose mutations with
high K complexity, but this may be all wrong.
