Testing the hypothesis that evolving in a changing environment increases commplexity.

Two versions:  
1)  Evolving genotypes to increase Tononi complexity.
2)  Evolving phenotypes to increase K complexity.

1)  Evaluate by the number of steps needed to evolve to a new phenotype.
    The new phenotype might be a fixed Hamming distance from the genotype's phenotype and
    have the same K complexity as the genotype's phenotype.

2)  Evaluate several phenotypes by ????

Experiment:

Generate a sequence of phenotypes with the same K complexity and a fixed Hamming distance apart.

Then try to epochal evolve genotypes to sequentially map to these phenotypes.  

Relate the success rate of the genotypes in following the sequences.  How is success related to Tononi complexity?

What about success rate as a fitness function?

See function neutral_evolution_glist( c::Circuit, funcs::Vector{Func}, gl::GoalList, max_steps::Integer; print_steps::Bool=false, select_prob::Float64=1.0 )
in Evolve.jl.

Conclusion:  hypotheses failed.
