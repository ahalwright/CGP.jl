Attempted to determine connectivity of neutral net of a goal g by finding a distance reducing path from chromosome c1
to chromosome c2 which both map to g.  Even in simple cases, this seems to almost always fail.

Implemented generating a set of chromosomes mapping to the common goal by doing a neutral walk starting at c2.
Then look to try to find a path starting at c1 that decreases the distance to the set rather than just c2.
This seems to help some.

Sample run:
p = Parameters(3,1,5,4)
g = randgoal( p.numinputs, p.numoutputs )
neutral_walk_connectivity( p, g, 500, 150000, c2_walk_length=50000 )

With small values (like 5) for numinteriors, often fails with len(all_chromes): 0

Compare to earlier more successful results on 10/26.
