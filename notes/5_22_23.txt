Revising the universal properties outline and Overleaf project.
evotech/pheno_network/universal_properties/Outline\ of\ universal\ properties\ paper3_22_23.docx

Adapted the log frequency vs rank plot to 3 inputs.
But then decided to stick with 4 inputs for frequency, density of log frequency, and robustness vs log frequency.
Saved a version that includes the 3-input results. 
universal_properties/zip/Universal properties (Version 104) 5_22_23.zip
Will then copy Evolvability paper sections back into the Universal properties project.

Need to revise abstract/introduction.
