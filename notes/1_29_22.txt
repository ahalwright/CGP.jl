Reassessing where I am in research.

See evotech/complexity/cce/NC_size_estimation_1_30_22.docx or a more recent version.

Many examples:
Locations of Fnc (find neutral components) results:
12_26_21:  Cartesian  5 gates, 3 lb, 4 funcs
12_27_21:  Cartesian  mostly 4 gates, 4 lb, 5 funcs
1_3_22:  LC  4 instructions 1 register
1_10_22:  LC  include avg_walk results, but only for 2 inputs

These results show three estimates of NC size:
robustness
evolvability
complexity

Non-rigorously: 
robustness seems to be correlated with NC size
evolvability does not seem to correlated with NC size
complexity may be correlated with NC size

Another potential measure of NC size is the following:
Do a random neutral walk starting at a genotype of the NC with a specified length.
Count the number of unique genotypes encountered.  Clearly, this measure is upper-bounded
by the size of the NC.  So intuitively, this should be a good estimate of NC size.
I have this programmed, but it is not fully debugged and tested.
