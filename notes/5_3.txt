Extending explore_complexity to 5x1 circuits and goals.

Problem 1:  transitioning from 4-input goals to 5-input goals.
  Unfortunately, the output of 5-input circuits which never use input 5 must have every even-numbered bit 0,
    so it is non-trivial to convert a 5-input goal into a 4-input goal or vice versa
  This is done by functions decrease_goal_inputs() and increase_goal_inputs() in change_goal_inputs.jl.

Problem 2:  the space of 5-input phenotypes is too large for the approach used for 4-input goals to work.
  So we need to select desirable goals from a subset of phenotype space.
  
  Approach 1:  Select desirable goals from a Hamming subset of phnenotype space, i. e., where some bits of goals are 
    constrained to be zero.  This naturally grades up from 4 inputs to 5 inputs.
  Approach 2:  Use difficulty-of-evolution as a complexity filter.  Find a very complex goal as the ultiimate overall goal.
    The select desirable goals in a neighborhoold of this ultimate goal.
  For now, approach 1 seems better.

  Approach for choosing 5-input Hamming subset goals:
    1.  Choose a random 4-input goal and convert it to a 5-input goal by using increase_goal_inputs().
    2.  Choose a random k-input goal (k = 1:8), convert it to a k+1 input goal using increase_goal_inputs(),
        shift it to the left by 1 bit, and OR it with the goal from step 1.
    This will produce goals from a 2^2^4*2^k space of phenotypes.  

Problem 3:  How to choose desirable goals?

  How many desirble goals to choose?  First try 600 to 1000.

  Problem:  Funnel desirable goals into a specific region of phenotype space.  Keep the number of desirable goals
    at any stage limited for efficiency reasons.  Try stages:  As desirable goals are found, add additional desirable 
    goals near found goals.
