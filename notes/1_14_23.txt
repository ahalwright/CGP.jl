Found that various versions of hamming() and hamming_distance() had been dropped from Chromosome.jl which meant that run_redundancy_mutate_all()
    crashed when running data/11_16_22/run_redundancy_mutateA.jl.  Fixed this problem.

Reposted the writeshortest not defined problem on the Github page for the CSV package.
