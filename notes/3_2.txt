Functions to implement population-based evolution for the circuit model and maybe also
test the LaBar/Adami 2016 hypothesis that small and large populations can achieve goals in 
different ways.

The basic function is pop_evolve() which evolves one population of circuits with fitness
defined by Hamming distance to one goal.  I found that selection was not seeming to 
be strong enough, so wrote a function to rescale fitness which is applied to the fitness
vector before each proportional selection.  It increases fitnesses below the 20% quantile 
up to this quantile, and then linearly rescales fitness so that the minimum fitness goes
to 0 and the maximum fitness goes to 1.  Maybe I will want to remove this.

Then multiple_pop_evolve() calls pop_evolve()
