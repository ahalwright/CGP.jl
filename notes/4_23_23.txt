Canalization and evolvability (and modularity and hierarchy)
  "canalizationâ€”the propensity of genomic structures to be mutationally robust against changes in 
  some dimensions of variation (ways in which individual or combinations of phenotypic traits can 
  change), whereas other, possibly more adaptive dimensions of variation, are free to vary"
  Huizinga 2018
  "canalizations are the result of structural organization in the genotype, in the form of modularity and 
  hierarchy, and such genomic structural organization increases the reproductive success of individuals."

Kashtan 2005 shows how circuits can be modularized.

How can a genotype-phenotype map exhibit canalization evolvavility?
There could be a difference in the mutation distribution (mutate_all) of the genotypes that map to a phenotype.
For example, the mutations of one genotype could give increased weight to bit A of the phenotype and 
  decreased weight to bit B, while another genotype could do the reverse.  

This seems to be a testable hypothesis.
