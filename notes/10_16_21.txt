Adapting geno_complexity() in Evolvability.jl for LinCircuits so that I can compute
evolution evolvability for LinCircuits.
Revised consolidate_dataframe() in Analyze.jl to separate the consolidation of the 
   dataframe from the file I/O.  There are now separate functions for this purposes.
Revised run_geno_complexity() in Evolvability.jl to add a "consolidate" keyword argument.
   When consolidate==true, consolidate_dataframe() is called.
Documented the parameters of run_geno_comolexity() which are very hard to undersand

Runs are in data/10_16_21/.
