Outline for a paper
1.  Finding complex solutions is important for all forms of evolution
2.  Complexity is hard to find as supported by our simulation and Hu 2020 results.
    a.  "This indicates that genotypically underrepresented targets are difficult to 
      find partially because they render the guidance of the fitness gradient less 
      effective. That is, reaching fitter phenotypes at a current step does not 
      necessarily lead to better paths for finding the target." Hu2020 p389, Fig. 8.
3.  Alternative definitions of evolvability and their strengths and weaknesses.
    a.  Wagner 2008 (degree evolvability):  Examples show natural approximations
        do not actually approximate the definition.
    b.  Degree evolvability versus 
3.  Evolvability ought to be measure of the ability to start at a phenotype and
    discover complexity.
