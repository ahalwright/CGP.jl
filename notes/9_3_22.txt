Result:  Testing the hypothesis that mutation from common to rare is unusual (sampling).

8 gates
data/9_3_22/mutation_evolvability8gts_4lb_4funcs_9_3_22A.csv
Result:  matrix nonzeros = 12

7 gates
data/9_3_22/mutation_evolvability8gts_4lb_4funcs_9_3_22B.csv
Result:  matrix nonzeros = 19

Same number of dest (rare) goals, 1 more source (common) goal for 8 gates.

Conclusion:  Using 7 gates gave no better results than using 8 gates.
