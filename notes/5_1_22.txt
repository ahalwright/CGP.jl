Implemented a test for Zenil's hypothesis that choosing mutations that increase Kolmogorov complexity will speed up Cartesian 
  evolution to a complex goal in src/complex_evolution.jl.
Based on "Algorithmically probable mutations reproduce aspects of evolution . . . " by Santiago Hernandes-Orcozo, Narsis Kiani, and Hector Zenil.
