Revisiting submission to Royal Society Interface.
Saved the current Latex evolvability paper in pheno_network/latex/evolvability_paper3_10_23.tex.
Then deleted shape space evolvability, entropy evolvability, and navigability methods and results sections.
Replace all occurences of " & " with "&" which reduces the number of "words" in a table.

The resulting file has 8149 words as counted by the "wc" program.  There are 767 words in the references
for a total of 8916 words.

Another method might be to extract the text from the pdf file.

However, we still have the introduction preview section, the discussion section, the conclusion section, and references.

The submission guidelines:  https://royalsocietypublishing.org/rsif/for-authors#question1
