Computed d_evolvability, s_evolvability, robustness and complexity using random walks technique of Hu2020
for both Chromosomes and LinCircuits.

Previous results 

LinCircuit results do not agree with previous sampling evolvability results.
sc(LCsevolv,LCdevolv) = -0.553
Chromosome results not agree with previous sampling evolvability results and GECCO paper.
sc(CRsevolv,CRdevolv) = 0.978

Both LinCircuit and Chromosome evolution evolvability are strongly negatively related to robustness (as expected)

Ran data/10_19_21/run_pheno_netE.jl on surt2 so that sampling evolvability would be computed in the same way
for chromecircuts and lincircuits using correlations() in correlations.jl.
