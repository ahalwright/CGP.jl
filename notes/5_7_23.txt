Promiscuous robustness according to Garcia-Galindo:

Note: using LinearAlgebra enables I = identity matrix.
Then N-I is mutation not including null mutation (which is the case for Garcia-Galindo)

The following is based on my idea for the overlap between G(g1) and G(g2):  G[:,g1]^T*G[:,g2].
Robustness of g would be sum_{gp \in {\cal N}_g} G[:,g]^T*G[:,gp]
The following shows that Garcia-Galindo genotype robustness agrees with my idea.
Proof of concept (but allows mutation to any unequal genotype instead of using N matrix)
map(g->(1//((K-1)*L))*sum(GG[:,g]'*GG[:,gp]*(1-delta(g,gp)) for gp=1:size(GG)[2]), 1:size(GG)[2])
3-element Vector{Rational{Int64}}:
 1//8
 7//32
 9//32


Successfully replicated eq (3) for the G-P map of Figure 2.
