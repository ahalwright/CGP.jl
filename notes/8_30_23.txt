Complexity is related to information.

Revisit Adami complexity.  
The conplexity of a phenotype is measured by the amount of information it contains about its environment.
This is measured by the reduction in entropy of a population adatpted to an environment in conparison
to the entropy of a population not adapted to the population.

Example:  There is a 0-1 variable X that individuals have.  For individuals outside of the environment,
X is random (like a coin toss).  Thus entropy is -2*(1/2 log_2 1/2) = 1 bit.  For individuals adapted 
to the environment, the entropy might be 0 because the value of X is fixed at some value (it doesn't 
matter what this value is).  Thus, the complexity would be 1 bit.

Suppose with have a digital circuit genotype with m gates.  What happens to the complexity when we add a gate?
Look at entropy in terms of the space of genotypes.  Assume that there are M genotypes with m gates and N
ways to add another gate so that there are M*N genotypes with m+1 gates.  So the number of outcomes with m
gates is M, and with m+1 gates it is M*N.
