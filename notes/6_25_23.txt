Exploring using only the NAND gate.

2 inputs.

Idea:  Circuits implementing other gates can be motifs or "automatically defined functions" which 
are steps to increased complexity.  Corresponds to entities in assembly theory.

output_values(circuit((1,2), ((3,XOR,1,2),)))  # [0x0006]
gate    input
XOR     0x6
NAND    0x7
NOR     0x1

Evolution to find circuit outputing 0x9 failed with 4 gates, succeeded with 5 gates.
Evolution to find circuit outputing 0x6 failed with 3 gates, succeeded with 4 gates.
Evolution to find circuit outputing 0x1 failed with 3 gates, succeeded with 4 gates.
Only 2 circuits outputing 0x1:
circuit((1,2), ((3,NAND,1,1), (4,NAND,2,3), (5,NAND,4,3), (6,NAND,5,5)))
circuit((1,2), ((3,NAND,2,2), (4,NAND,3,1), (5,NAND,3,4), (6,NAND,5,5)))
These could be examples of motifs.  Could replace them with NOR gates.
