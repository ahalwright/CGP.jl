Can I do mutual information between a genotype space and a phenotype space?

Assume a positive fitness function on phenotype space, and define probabilities
by normalizing the fitness function to sum to 1.

Assume a population of genotypes and define the probability distribution over 
genotypes given by normalizing the population frequencies.  This will be a
probability distribution over those genotypes that actually occur in the 
population.  With this assumption, all probabilities will be positive avoiding
division by zero in the formula for mutual information.

Problem:  How does one define the joint distributionn? 
Requirements:  The distribution over genotypes and the distribution over phenotypes
must be marginals of the joint distribution.  And if one uses multiplication to
define the joint distribution, then the two distributions will be independent 
and mutual information will be zero.

The idea has to be that there is one element of the joint distribution for each
genotype (chromosome).  

Example:  Suppose we have 3 genotypes A, B, and C.  A and B map to phenotype X
while C maps to phenotype Y.  Assume A, B, C are equiprobable.  Thus,
Pr(X) = 2/3, Pr(Y) = 1/3.
