What is old and what is new in the evolvability paper.  Detailed review of G-P models described in Ahnert 2017 and Manrubia 2021

Old:  Universal properties
  Degree (or Wagner) phenotype evolvability TODO: connect degree evolvability with Wagner evolvability in paper.

New:
  Two size genotype parameters: number of inputs and number of gates
  Neutral and epochal evolution
    Used for deriving properties of the G-P map
  Evolution evolvability
  Phenotype network: new to biologists, old for genetic programming readers
  Sampling evolvability
  Total evolvability
  Shape-space evolvability
  Long neutral walk evolvability
  Evolution of 5, 6, 7 input phenotypes

Possible experiments for other G-P maps:
  Implement epochal evolution
  Compute evolution evolvability
  Compare evolution and sampling evolvability
  Appromate phenotype network by random walk sampling
    
TODO:
  How is phenotype evolvability approximated in universal properties papers?
  "In the RNA, HP and Polyomino GP maps the majority of phenotypes has been 
      shown to lie in close proximity of any genotype [18,22,26]. This is because 
      of the high-dimensional nature of GP maps." Ahnert 2017 page 7.

Universal properties models:

    (more detail page 62)
    RNA 3.3
      Hints from inverse folding algorithms 3.3.3
        Note: epochal evolution might be an effective inverse folding algorithm
    Artificial life 3.4
      High degree of robustness
      Probability of transitioning from a larger to a chosen smaller neutral set by point 
          mutations is much smaller than that in the reverse direction.
      
    (rest of paper overview)
    Mean field model 5.4  Schaper & Louis (2014) "Arrival of the Frequent"
      Note:  Manrubia reverses the subscripts from Shaper
      \phi_{\xi,\chi} = probability that a point mutation for genotypes that map to phenotype \xi generates
          a genotype for phenotype \chi averaged over all genotypes that map to \xi.
          Note:  φ = \phi,  ξ = \xi,  χ = \chi
      Interestingly, for RNA, as well as for a number of other GP maps [12], it was found to a good first 
          approximation that if ξ ∕= χ then φ_{ξχ} ≈ f_χ, (6) where f_χ is the global frequency of phenotype χ, 
          i.e., the fraction of genotypes that map to χ.
      The mean field model predicts that for many different starting phenotypes ξ, the probability that a 
          different phenotype χ will appear as potential variation will scale as fχ.
