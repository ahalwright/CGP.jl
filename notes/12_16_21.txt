Have looked into Julia multi-threading and came up with a race example and 
a method to do synchronization in ~/julia/threading/race_example.jl.
Creating a GitHub repository ?? for this example.

Rewrote PhenotypeNetwork.jl to PhenoNet.jl using this technique.
Specific timing example:
Copied data/10_19_21/run_pheno_netH.jl to data/12_16_21/run_pheno_netH.jl changing only the date 
    and a comment.  Ran the 12/16 version with src/PhenoNet.jl loaded and 26 threads.  
    Time for 12_16_21 run:  32190 seconds.
    Time for 10_19_21 run:   3840 seconds.
