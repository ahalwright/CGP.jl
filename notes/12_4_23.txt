Robot companions

My concern is the a person's robot companion will be both be able to collect lots of data on the person and influence
the person's opinions.  If the person views the companion as a friend, then the person will be very susceptible to the 
opinions expressed by the robot.  This can give the company that creates these robots the ability to subtly influence many people.
Don't forget that elderly are voters.
