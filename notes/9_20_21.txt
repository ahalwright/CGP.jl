Got construct_pheno_net() of PhenotypeNetwork.jl to work----see below.
The hard part was getting count_outputs() of RecordOutputs.jl to work
for both Chromosomes and LinCircuits.

Also, renamed vect_to_int and int_to_vect functions to have more descriptive names
in LinCircuit.jl, and fixed a lot of bugs.

include("../test/testLinChromosome.jl")

p = Parameters(2,1,4,2)
numcircuits=3
count_outputs( 3, p, numcircuits, use_lincircuit=false )
#  ([0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], Array{Int128,1}[[], [], [], [], [27574300], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [1258331], [20842475]])

count_outputs( 3, p, numcircuits, use_lincircuit=true )

nreps = 100
construct_pheno_net( p, nreps, numcircuits, use_lincircuit=false )
