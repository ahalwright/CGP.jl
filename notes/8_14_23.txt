Universal properties of an Avida model.  Dropped navigability from UP paper. 

Work on why the Avida model and the Fortuna model do not have the universal properties.

Avida:  What is the phenotype?

Phenotypes:  The subset of the 9 possible Boolean functions that the organism can compute.
Thus, there are 2^9 = 512 phenotypes.

A logic function's complexity is the number of NAND instructions needed to compute it.

A phenotype's complexity is the sum of the complexity of the logic functions that the
phenotype can compute.


Universal properties:

* Bias and frequency: yes, but complicated
* Robustness proportional to log of frequency.  NO.
  Robustness weakly positively related to frequency.  YES.  Figure 4.
* Genotype evolvability negatively related to robustness.  
  "phenotypic complexity comes at the price of lower phenotypic robustness."
  "This genotypic evolvability increases with phenotypic complexity".
  Combines to give a negative relationship between genotype evolvability and robustness.
* Phenotype evolvability positively related to phenotype robustness.
  "Fig 4 shows that evolvability increases with robustness for the 13 phenotypes 
  for which we have frequency data" page 10
  "phenotypic complexity comes at the price of lower phenotypic robustness. Page 7.
* Genetic correlation.
