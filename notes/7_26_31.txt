Found that mutrate was set too large (at 0.1) to find medium frequency 3x1 goals.
Fixed function run_run_pop_evolvability() in Pop_evolvability.jl to be compatible with
   changes made to run_pop_evolvability() and pop_evolvability().  
Test data:  data/7_23_21/run_pop_evolvabilityG.jl which is copied to 7_26_21 on lycosa and surt2
