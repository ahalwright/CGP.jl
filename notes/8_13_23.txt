Parallelizing navigability.

Added pmap to function run_navigate_epoch() in Navigate.jl.

Problems with setting the global variable Ones in worker processes.
Had to change "run" files in data/8_11_23/ to add @everywhere when parameters and funcs are set.


Big picture issues:

I continue think that the most important references are Manrubia (2021) and Ahnert (2017)
(especially Manrubia) because these directly address the significance of GP maps.

From our point of view, neutrality is the most important property of GP maps with the
universal properties.  "Circuits computing the same function form large connected networks"
(Raman and Wagner 2011).  Furthermore, as one follows a neutral network, the phenotypes
encountered keep changing.

This means that neutral evolution is very effective at exploring both genotype and phenotype 
space, and the epochal evolution is very effective at finding a genotype that maps to a given 
phenotype.
