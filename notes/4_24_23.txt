Canalization.  Sleeping Beauties by A. Wagner
I discovered a new book "Sleeping beauties" by Andreas Wagner which I will attempt to summarize:

I am attaching the New Scientist review that alerted me to this book.

He claims that innovation that can survive is extremely common and cheap.
These innovations survive at low frequency for a very long time until the right conditions come along
to make the frequency of the innovation grow.  Two biological examples are grasses which originated
65 million years ago but did not become ecololgically relevant until 25 million years ago.
Mammals are another example.  A cultural example is the wheel which he claims first appeared in
independently in two locations 3,500 BCE, but did become common until much later.

An important mechanism is promiscuity.  For example, an enzyme is promiscuous if it can catalyze 
chemical reactions in addition to its primary biological purpose.

The abilities of these innovations to survive is clearly due to the fact that they are fitness
neutral.  In terms of genotype-phenotype maps, long tail of the redundancy vs rank plot
(Figure 2 of evolvavility paper) represents the very many low redundancy phenotypes that may
represent these innovations.

Canalization  The next 4 paragraphs from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canalisation_(genetics)
"Canalisation is a measure of the ability of a population to produce the same phenotype regardless of 
variability of its environment or genotype. It is a form of evolutionary robustness."

Assimilation
Genetic assimilation is a process described by Conrad H. Waddington by which a phenotype originally 
produced in response to an environmental condition, such as exposure to a teratogen, later becomes 
genetically encoded via artificial selection or natural selection.

Evolutionary capacitance
The canalisation metaphor suggests that some phenotypic traits are very robust to small perturbations, 
for which development does not exit the canal, and rapidly returns down, with little effect on the final 
outcome of development. But perturbations whose magnitude exceeds a certain threshold will break out of 
the canal, moving the developmental process into uncharted territory. For instance, the study of an 
allelic series for Fgf8, an important gene for craniofacial development, with decreasing levels of 
gene expression demonstrated that the phenotype remains canalised as long as the expression level is 
above 40% of the wild-type expression.[16]

Strong robustness up to a limit, with little robustness beyond, is a pattern that could increase 
evolvability in a fluctuating environment.[17] Canalisation of a large set of genotypes into a limited 
phenotypic space has been suggested as a mechanism for the accumulation, in a neutral manner, 
of mutations that could otherwise be deleterious.[18] Genetic canalisation could allow for evolutionary 
capacitance, where genetic diversity accumulates in a population over time, sheltered from natural 
selection because it does not normally affect phenotypes. This hidden diversity could then be unleashed 
by extreme changes in the environment or by molecular switches, releasing previously cryptic genetic 
variation that can then contribute to a rapid burst of evolution,[18] a phenomenon termed decanalisation. 
Cycles of canalization-decanalization could explain the alternating periods of stasis, where genotypic 
diversity accumulates without morphological changes, followed by rapid morphological changes, where 
decanalization releases the phenotypic diversity and becomes subject to natural selection, in the fossil 
record, thus providing a potential developmental explanation for the punctuated equilibrium.[17]
