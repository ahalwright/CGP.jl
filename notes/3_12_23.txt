Conclusions for the whole paper.

We can compute/approximate the phenotype network.

Wagner evolvability is degree evolvability.  

Why we are interested in low redundancy phenotypes:  discovering complexity.  Other reasons?

Sampling substantially underestimates the evolvability of low redundancy phenotypes.  Evolution evolvability is much more accurate.

Mutation from high to low redundancy is exponentiallly unlikely based on the difference in redundancy.  

Evolution from high to low redundancy requires strong selection to overcome redundancy properties of the G$\rightarrow$P  map.
    Epochal evolution can succeed because it has strong selection.
