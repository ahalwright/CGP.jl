Tentatively decided to write code to implement comparison of different functions
applied to a Chromosome by implementing 1+lambda evolution.  function next_chromosome()
would generate lambda new chromosomes which would be selected first for fitness
(match to a goal) and second to a user-specified function from chromosomes to Floats.
This function might be:  Frenken mutual information, Tononi complexity, Tononi
degeneracy, and Tononi redundancy.
