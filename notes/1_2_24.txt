Trying to make sense out of the different versions of evolvability.
In particular: degree, strength, entropy, and evolution.

I am guessing that these are all computed from the weighted and unweighted phenotype adjacency matrices.

Except that 
function evolution_evolvability( p::Parameters, funcs::Vector{Func}, ph::Goal, ncircuits::Int64, max_tries::Int64, max_steps::Int64 )
(newly written) computes evolution evolvality from scratch.

These matrices can be computed either by evolution or sampling.

Degree evolvability would be the number of adjacent phenotypes in the unweighted phenotype adjacency matrix.

Strength evolvability would be the number of adjacent phenotypes in the weighted phenotype adjacency matrix.

Entropy evolvability is the entropy of the row of the phenotype in weighted phenotype adjacency matrix.

CSV files that show sampling evolvability results:

data/3_13_23/phnet_matrix3_14_23E.csv  for 3 inputs, 7 gates, 4 lb random walk sampling.

1/3/24:  Testing the hypothesis that higher phenotype evolvability implies that a small number of steps to
evolve from the phenotype.
