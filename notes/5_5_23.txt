Message to Cheyenne:

Hello Cheyenne,

I hope you are OK and not so stressed.

I was scheduled to take a woman on a easy mountain bike ride, and I hurried to get home in time and to meet her at the Rattlesnake trailhead, so I wasted a lot of time.

I asked Jesse about the lecturer recruitment timeline, and he said that human resources will not allow any offers to be make until all candidates have been decided on.  The other lecturer candidate interviews in the last week in May, so that is the earliest that a formal offer could be made.  The same issue comes up with our faculty candidate Zedong Peng.  I think Jesse has informed him that he is the department's choice.  I will ask Jesse tomorrow if a similar informal commitment can be made.

Our faculty candidate Carlos Oliver is giving a Zoom talk tomorrow at noon.  Carlos will be interviewing May 17-18, and our other candidate Lucy will interview in the last week in May.

I can meet any time.  I have been thinking about the meeting that you had with Jesse just before our recruitment meeting at Cambies, and we could discuss this.

I have been refereeing a paper for Royal Society Interface.  I am considering extending the results of this paper as a next paper after complexity.  The paper has lots of hard-to-understand formulas, and I found an error in a very crucial formula.

Alden
