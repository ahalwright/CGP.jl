Testing hypotheses on parity and shift_extend. 
Shift_extend goals are goals that start with a 3-input or 4-input goal, extend it for another input by adding 
the reverse goal to the bit string, and then further extend to more inputs by adding copies of the goal to the bit string.

Some files/results are in 4_28, 4_29, 4_30.
