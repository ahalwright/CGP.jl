Wrote test_evolve_function.jl.  Includes combine_circuits() that combines two 1-output
circuits with the same number of gates into one 2-output circuit.  

Decided that evolve_function() needs to be rewritten.  
Objective:
  Given two 1-output circuits, combine them into a 2-output circuit, and then evolve
    to minimize the number of gates while retaining the same output.  I tried this
    once before, and it didn't work very well.  Perhaps do evolution with more than
    1 mutation per step.

5/10:  function reduce_numactive() in src/evolve_function.jl and test/test_evolve_function.jl
data in data/5_10/.  
Results definitively show that doing more than 1 mutation when running reduce_numactive() 
does not reduce number active any more than using just 1 mutation.

5/28:  Needs to be redone because of bug in mutate_chromosome().
