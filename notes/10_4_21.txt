Sorting out the different methods of computing evolvability and complexity for 3x1 phenotypes
with the gate set AND, OR, NAND, NOR (but not XOR).

random_walk.jl
Went back to data/1_3 for earlier runs.  Copied data/1_3/run_random_walksB.jl to data/10_3_21 and changed settings.
data/1_2/run_random_walksM.jl ran giving robust_evo_by_walks1_2M.csv with 5000 walks, 5000 steps, 400 processes.
But on 10_3_21, run_random_walksG.jl crashed with stack overflow errors when run in julia 1.6.3 and jula 1.5.3,
but succeded using julia 1.4.2 (with some difficulties):  data/10_3_21/run_random_walksG.jl and robust_evo_by_walks10_3_21G.csv
This was for 7 gates, 4 levsback.  Circuits discovered for all phenotypes including 0x69 and 0x96.
Results include s_evolvability and d_evolvability.  d_evolvability and s_evolvability increase with the number of walks and steps.

PhenotypeNetwork.jl
Calculates the phenotype network by running count_outputs_parallel() and then doing mutate_all for up to numcircuits of
the discovered genotypes.  Does run using LinCircuits.
pmap parallelized on about 9/24/21, but completely failed and used up all memory on surt2.  On 10/4, commened out pmap().
Results in data/9_24_21 for both chromosomes and LinCircuits.  Chromosome results being redone on 10_4.
Lincircuit runs for 10^9 genotypes do not find quite a number of phenotypes.
Also does Markov chain stationary states which is eigenvector centrality of Hu ???.

Parallelized:  construct_pheno_net_parallel() in PhenotypeNetwork.jl.

AdaptEvo.jl
Computes adaptive evolvability and does some comparison to evolvabilities.

Specific run of data/10_4_21/run_pheno_netA.jl" on lycosa p=4:
3x1 7_4
nreps = 100000 = 10^5
numcircuits = 1000
time:  552 seconds.

5 specific runs of data/10_4_21/run_pheno_netX.jl" for X = B,C,D,E,F on lycosa (B) and surt2 (C,D,E,F).

Generating jld files so results can be combined.
