New definition of total evolvability based on symmetrizing the Boolean pheno network adjacency matrix B.

I realized that total evolvability is just evolvability based on symmetrizing the Boolean pheno network adjacency matrix B.  
More precisely, let B be the 2^n by 2^n matrix where B[i,j] is 1 iff there is a mutation from a genotype of phenotype i to 
a genotype of phenotype j,  The symmetrized matrix S is defined by S[i,j]=1 iff either B[i,j]=1 or B[j,i]=1.  
Total evolvability is just degree evolvability for S.

I am also thinking about how to present evolvability.  Perhaps order the phenotypes by redundancy, and show the 16 by 16 matrix 
corresponding to the 8 least redundant (rare) and 8 most redundant (common) phenotypes.  This is closer to what we sent Ting 
and Wolfgang when we asked them to collaborate.  

I am also thinking about how epochal evolution traverses the pheno net matrix.

Order the rows of the matrix by increasing fitness, and order the columns by increasing redundancy.  
There will be bands of rows corresponding to equal fitness and an epoch stays within a band, while
starting a new epoch corresponds to moving from a band to a higher band.
Evolving from left to right is easy while evolving from right to left is hard. 


The naviagability section shows that most evolutions from a random genotype to a random phenotype are from
right to left (but this may only minimally hold for the 3-input case).
