Normalizing genotypes

A gate can be normalized without changing its function by reordering the inputs into numerical order.
Example:  (3,NAND,4,2) ==> (3,NAND,2,4).
A genotype can be normalized by normalizing all of its gates.

This will substantially reduce the number of genotypes. However, considering only normalized genotypes
biases gates to those whose inputs are the same.  Thus, such genotypes now have higher relative frequencies.
