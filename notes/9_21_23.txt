Summary of "Three trends in the history of life: an evolutionary syndrome" \cite{mcshea2016three} by Daniel McShea.

Three trends:  
1)  rise in complexity in the sense of hierarchy.
2)  the increase in complexity in the sense of differentiation.
3)  the loss of differentiation at the lowest levels in organisms.

1) Increasing Hierarchy:

Hierarchy is levels of nestedness, levels of parts within wholes, and Trend 1 is the 
addition of successive levels over time

There is no implication that higher-level objects are better adapted or more sophisticated.

The trend is only in the maximum. 

Levels of hierarchy:  prokaryote, eukaryote, multicellular, colony.

2) Increasing complexity:

A second trend is the rise in number of part types or degree of differentiation among parts. 

The clearest instance of this trend is the rise in number of cell types over the past 540 million 
years within the animals, the metazoans.

3) The Complexity Drain

The parts themselves are getting simpler. As the cells of multicellular
organisms are becoming more and more different from each other, the cells are losing part types
