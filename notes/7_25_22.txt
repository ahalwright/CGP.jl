Programmed versions of complexity based on equations (5) and (6) of Tononi et al. (1994) in cmplx5.jl.
These versions correspond closely to the corresponding equations, and so are very intuitive.
But it turns out that they are much less efficient that complexity5() which is based on the get_bits() function.
They are a good further test of correctness.
TODO:  Revise test/test_degen_complexity.jl and test/test_exec_time_complexity.jl.
TODO:  Revise integration funtions.
