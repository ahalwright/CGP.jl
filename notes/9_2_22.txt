Wrote functions:

k_complexity_mutate_all() in Complexity.jl:  See comments on function.  All based on sampling rather than evolution.
matrix_dataframe_count_nonzeros() in Complexity.jl
K_complexity_negation_check()  checks that the K complexity of a phenotype is equal to that of the one's complement of the phenotype

Revised:
submatrix_to_dataframe() in evolvable_evolvability.jl which is used in k_complexity_mutate_all().
