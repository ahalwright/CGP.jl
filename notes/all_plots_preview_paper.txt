Wagner outline:
Note:  sequence <==> genotype,  structure <==> phenotype
1.  Genotype and phenotype robustness
2.  High sequence robustness means low sequence evolvability
3.  High structure robustness means high structure evolvability
4.  Populations evolving on large neutral networks can access greater amounts of variation
5.  Even when populations or mutation rates are small, populations with robust phenotypes 
    access more variation
6.  An evolutionary searchâ€™s ability to find a target structure is only weakly correlated with
    robustness

3. Properties of GP maps, comparison of polynomial, RNA, and HP models
3.1. Redundancy 
3.2. Phenotype bias 
3.3. Components and connectivity
3.4. Shape space covering
      Shape space covering is measured by counting the average fraction of phenotypes found when 
      applying a given number of independent mutations (the radius, n) to a genotype in the GP map. 
3.5. Robustness
3.6. Robustness versus evolvability
