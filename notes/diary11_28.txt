Wrote sampling.jl to test the following hypothesis:

See the document sampling.tex on Windows Dropbox\evotech\complexity\notes\tex
for a revised version.

Given an urn with $n-k$ black balls and $k$ white balls.
Take repeated samples with the following procedure:
  * pick a ball from the urn
  * if the ball is black, return to the urn
  * if the ball is white, replace with a black (or blue) ball
Modeling the expected probability $p_i$ of a white ball on sample $i$ for $i = 0,1,2,\ldots$.
Hypothesis:  $p_i = k/n*(1-1/n)^i$.

Derivation:

Clearly, $p_0 = k/n$.

On trial 1, the expected number of white balls is $(k - p_0)=(k-k/n)= k*(1-1/n)$ so 
$p_1= k/n*(1-1/n)

On trial 2, the expected number of white balls is 
$(k-p_0-p_1)=k-k/n-k/n*(1-1/n)= k*(1-1/n-(1/n)*(1-1/n) = k*(1-1/n-1/n-1/n^2) = k*(1-1/n)^2$
so $p_2= k/n*(1-1/n)^2$

Instead of modeling probabilities, model the expected number of white balls.

Look at:
julia> asl=average_sample_lists( 10000, n, k, 500 )  
julia> ssl = asl.*n       # Expected number of white balls


Testbed for the evolution of complexity.

Random sample evolvability vs Neutral walk evolvability.

Should we invite Wagner as a co-author?

Hypothesis:  increasing the number of gates will weaken or reverse the negative relationship 
between evolvavility and robustness (and the other interesting related relationships).
