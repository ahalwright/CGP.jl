TODO list from meeting with Cheyenne on 5/27/23

1.  Table 3 remove all but 2, 3, and 4 gates.  DONE
2.  Extend Figure 3 to 10 and 12 gates.
3.  Move Table 4 to after discussion of it.
4.  Figures 5 & 6:  Change xlabel to "exact evolvability".
5.  Figure 8:  Remove "exact evolability" vertical line.
6.  Figure 9:  Shape space.  Do 8 and 14 gates rather than evolution
7.  Figure 10:  drop (we don't need to do 4 input shape space).
8.  Figure 4:  Add neutral correlations null model.
9.  Add mathematical notation for definitions.
