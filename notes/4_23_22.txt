Instructions for Cooper to try out Julia code for the CGP project.

If you haven't already done so, go to 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/develop/git/install-and-set-up-git
and install Git for Windows.

I also suggest that you install "Windows Terminal" which can be found in 
Microsoft Store.  It is a better version of Command Prompt and Windows Powershell.

Go to https://github.com/ahalwright/CGP.jl and click on the "Code" tab.
You will see a "Clone" window with https://github.com/ahalwright/CGP.jl.git.
Use a Windows Terminal prompt go to the folder where you want to install the code.
Do "git clone https://github.com/ahalwright/CGP.jl.git".  This will install
the current version of my code in a subdirectory CGP.jl.  My code is in the
subdirectory "src" and my notes are in subdirectory "notes".  You don't need
to be very concerned with the notes.  But this file should be notes/4_23_22.txt.

Then you will need to Julia install all of the packages that I use.  
You can run "julia -L install_packages.jl" to install these packages.
It will probably take 15-20 minutes to pre-compile many packages.

To start a Julia prompt with packages loaded, do "julia -L CGP.jl".

To load specific additional Julia files, such as "neutral_evol.jl", do
"include("neutral_evol.jl").  If you write your own functions, this is
how you can load them into Julia.

The file "neutral_evol.jl" includes instructions for running as comments.
