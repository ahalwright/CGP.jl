Complexity/information ideas:

1.  Given a goal phenotype, use epochal evolution to evolve a circuit which maps to the goal.
Conjecture:  The mutual information between the output of the current circuit and the goal
decreases somewhat monotonically to zero.

2.  Similar to the GECCO paper choose random 4-input 1-output goals.  Evolve circuits to these goals as in 
the GECCO paper except start with a small number of gates and work up to an increased number of gates.

2a.  Measure the mutual information between the goals and the output the evolving circuits.
Question:  does the largest mutual information predict whether a descendant of the circuit
will converge to the goal?  

2b.  Find a way to use Adami's definition of complexity to measure the complexity of a circuit
relative to a goal phenotype (the environment).  Perhaps let the entropy of the output of 
random circuits with a given number of gates correspond to the entropy of a random sequence.
Let complexity = random circuit entropy - circuit output entropy.
How does this relate to mutual information between circuit output and goal phenotyp?
