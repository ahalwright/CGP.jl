Summary of UP paper 2/20/24

Abstract:  First 2 1/2 sentences are background, last 1 1/2 sentences are new results.

Introduction:
  Sections:
    Genotypes and phenotypes
    Structural properties table
    Fitness landscapes
    Phenotype and genotype networks
    Epochal evolution
    Robustness and evolvability
    Genetic correlations

Discussion
    Sentence recapitulating results
    Arrival of the frequent
    Survival of the flattest
    Claim that these hold for additional forms of evolution
    Summary of the effect of increasing the number of gates

Conclusions
    Genetic correlations and neutral evolution
    Seven universal properties conclusions.

Question:  What is the role of the exact results?
    Supplementary information or main paper?
