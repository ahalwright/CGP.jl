Notes for meeting with Cheyenne:

Wagner (2008) results that I could test:

1.  Pheno evolvability negatively correlated with genotypic robustness (Figure 1)

2.  High phenotype robustness means high phenotype evolvability.  (Figure 2) Can be roughly taken from my plot.    

3.  "This means that most genotypes that occur in the neighbourhoods of different sequences along a neutral network are different from each other." Page 95.

4.  "Populations evolving on large neutral networks can access greater amounts of variation."  Page 95 and Figure 3.  My current results seem to completely contradict this hypothesis.

5.  "Even when populations or mutation rates are small, populations with robust phenotypes access more variation." Page 97.  Would require population evolution to test which I am not currently doing.

6.  An evolutionary searchâ€™s ability to find a target genotype is only weakly correlated with robustness.  Page 97 and Figure 4.


Important questions from Wagner 2008:

1.  "how robust and evolvable are biologically important phenotypes, such as RNA structures?" Page 99.

2.  "how general is the positive association between phenotypic robustness and evolvability that I showed for RNA structures?" Page 99.  

3.  "this work does not ask about the evolutionary forces that might cause high evolvability, of which there may be many"  Page 99.

More literature search needed for additional results on these hypotheses and questions.
