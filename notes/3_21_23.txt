Ideas for conclusions for evolvability paper.

1.  The digital circuit G-P map has the ``universal" properties of biologically-oriented G-P maps.

2.  We compare phenotype evolvability computed by three methods:  exact, approximation by sampling, and 
    approximation by using an evolutionary algorithm to invert the G-P map.  These methods give different
    relationships between evolvability and other properties like robustness.

3.  Mutation from high redundancy to low redundancy is exponentially unlikely in the differences in log redundancies.
    Figures 9 and 10 of current paper.

4.  Evolution from high redundancy to low redundancy.  Figure 11 of the current paper.

5.  Selection using epochal evolution can overcome the the barrier to evolution from high to low redundancy even
    when the number of phenotypes is astronomical and the number of genotypes is hyper-astronomical.


Question:  Do we use complexity to justify the importance of discovering low redundancy phenotypes?
