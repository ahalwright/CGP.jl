Finally got GECCO paper submitted.
Problems with PDF format.  From e-mail to Alberto Tonda:
I finally found the problem.  I had been using Foxit PDF reader to embed fonts.  There are two steps.  
First, I use either Foxit or Word to save to a pdf file.  Second, I would open the resulting pdf file 
in Foxit and print to another pdf file using the embed fonts option.  This second step changed the page 
size.  So when I changed to doing the second step with Adobe Acrobat Reader DC printing to "Microsoft 
Print to PDF", it did not change the page size and this file was accepted.  So the problem was not in Word.
