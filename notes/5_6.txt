Working on increasing the number of goal inputs and increasing the number of goal inputs.
Function to increase goal inputs and inverse function to decrease goal inputs. Test that inverse is correct.
Function to combine the goals of a 2-output goal into a goal with one more input.

See change_goal_inputs.jl

Steps for symbiosis:
1.  Independently evolve circuits to map to two goals with m and n outputs.
    Initially, m = n = 1.
2.  Create goals into a single m+n output goal,and evolve with some selection
    to reduce the number of gates.
3.  Combine the m+n outputs into a goal with a smaller number of outputs.
4.  Transition circuit mapping to the m+n output goal to a circuit that might
    be closer to a circuit that maps to the goal of step 3.  This is non-trivial.
    
Perhaps steps 3 and 4 are unnecessary.
