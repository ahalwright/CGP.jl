Idea: Binary constraint satisfaction and other similar prolbems are examples of G-P maps with the "universal" proprties.

One alternative:
Phenetype:  Instance of the problem in a suitable representation language.
Genotype:  A solution to an instance of the problem.
Advantage:  Finding a genotype that maps to the phenotype is solving the the problem.
Problem:  What is the G-P map?  Given a genotype (a problem solution), how do we find all phenotypes (problems)
   that have that genotype as a solution?  This is not a single-valued function.


Another alternative:
Genetype:  Instance of the problem in a suitable representation language.
Phenotype:  
  1.  A solution to an instance of the problem.    How do we choose which solution?
  2.  The set of all solutions to instance.   What is the significance if sets differe slightly?
