Rewrote README.md for CGP.jl---very out of date.

Improved comments for Func.jl.

Ran data/6_25_22/run_count_outputs_lincirc{B,C}.jl with CSV file:
count_outputs_lc_4funcs_3inputs_6insts_2regs_{B,C}.csv 
Lincircuit 3x1 4 gate types 10^{10} samples, under 1 hour running time
B:  7 instructions 2 registers:  Minimum count 4
C:  6 instructions 2 registers:  Minimum count 0  for 4 phenotypes

Could be used for a start genotypes for random walk evolvability.
