Doing a density plot of log redundancy for genotype sampling and phenotype sampling.
These are called G sampling and P sampling by Dingle 2015.  See Figure 2 of Dingle 2015.

P sampling:
function redundancy_dict() produces a dictionary mapping phenotypes to redundancy for 3x1 8gts4lb and 4x1 10gts5lb.

G sampling:
data/counts/counts/count_outputs_ch_5funcs_4inputs_10gates_5lb_EG.csv has a 2*10^10 sample of genotypes mapped to phenotypes.
These phenotypes can be converted by redundancy by redundancy_dict.

TODO:  reconsider.  Construct a mapping of phenotypes to redundancy weighted by redundancy.
