Renamed src/evo_dict.jl to Evo_dict.jl, and added it to CGP.jl.

Note that Evo_dict uses an evolutionary approximation of 
evolvability.

Added the computation of a matrix representation of phenotype network
where nodes are phenotypes and edges are mutations that take a genotype
of the source node to a genotype of the destination node.  Added 
writing a hexadecimal and a decimal version of csvfiles representing
these matrices as output csvfiles. 

Data is in data/7_11_21.

Will compute the entire phenotype network for 3x1 goals on surt2.
