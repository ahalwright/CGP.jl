Renamed src/evo_dict.jl to Evo_dict.jl, and added it to CGP.jl.

Created plot log redund vs K complexity
using Plots; gr()
lg10(x) = x > 0 ? log10(x) : 0
kdf = read_dataframe("../data/7_11_22/k_complexity7_11_22redundD.csv")
scatter(kdf.num_gates,map(lg10,kdf.ints7_4),labels="log redundancy vs Kolmororov complexity")
plot!(ylabel="log redundancy", xlabel="Kolmogorov complexity",title="log redundancy vs K complexity 3x1 7gts4lb")
savefig("../data/7_11_22/log_redund_vs_K_complexity3x1_7gts4lb.png")

Note that Evo_dict uses an evolutionary approximation of 
evolvability.

Added the computation of a matrix representation of phenotype network
where nodes are phenotypes and edges are mutations that take a genotype
of the source node to a genotype of the destination node.  Added 
writing a hexadecimal and a decimal version of csvfiles representing
these matrices as output csvfiles. 

Data is in data/7_11_21.

Versions of the matrix G-P phenotype map are in the files 
data7_11_21/evo_dict7_11_21M_phmatrix_hex.csv (100 circuits)
and evo_dict7_11_21M_phmatrix_hex.csv (600 circuits).
These are computing by evolution rather than sampling, and
are for the Cartesian representation rather than the LinearGP
representation.
