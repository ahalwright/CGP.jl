Ideas on robot consciousness

Based on "Other Minds" by Peter Godfrey-Smith.

The keys to consciousness are:
1)  A mental map of the organism and its environment based one or more senses (such as vision).
2)  A link to the affective system of the organism that evaluates actions and the environment to
  rewards for the organism.  (Need to reread this aspect of the book.)

Scenario:  Components:
1)  A reasoning component which could currently be thought of as a LLM.  This might be thought of as static.
2)  An interface component that uses the reasoning component to choose actions to do in an environment.
    Maybe there are subcomponents for each environment (such as each person that the system interacts with.

My major point is that the interface component would naturally evolve to choosing subcomponents that have
the greatest chance of surviving.  In other works, it would evolve to favor subcomponents that are likely
to persist.  This is similar to what has happened for social media.

Further, it might evolve subcomponents that where could convince the corresponding person to download the
system to the person's computer.
