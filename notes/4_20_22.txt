Revisiting evolution of Adami complexity described in notes/4_4_22.txt.  

Moved write_df_to_csv() from RecordOutputs.jl to a new file Utilities.jl.
Now running simple_pop_evolve() (which is in adami.jl) works and writes to 
an appropriate CSV file in data/4_20_22.

See http://www.cgplibrary.co.uk/files2/CartesianGeneticProgramming-txt.html#Cartesian_Genetic_Programming
for an overview of CGP.  Of particular note is the description of the evolution strategy.
"The evolutionary strategy commonly used by CGP is to select one parent from each generation and use it to produce four children 
via mutation alone.  The next generation then comprises of the selected parent and the four generated children.  The population 
size is therefore five; four children plus one parent.  This strategy is formally written as (1 + 4)-ES."

My evolution strategy is (1+1)-ES:  The next generation comprises the selected parent and one generated child.

I should compare (1+1)-ES with (1+4)-ES.
