Issues with infinite population model.  InfPop.jl, jupyter notebooks, Overleaf project Infinite Population model.

Major problem:  the algorithm does no adaptation of the model.

My current model has M as the evolvability matrix, P as the population vector, and F as the diagonal fitness matrix.

1.  Then the model of P <- (M \times F)^n P does not work.  M \times F applies fitness by multiplying M[:,i] by F[i,i] 
    which multiplies the i th column by the i th fitness.  It looks like we want F \times M instead.  Thus, the model 
    would be  P <- (F \times M)^n P.

2.  We probably want to introduce a mutation rate \mu where mutation would be  P <- (P + \mu M)/|P + \mu M| where
    | x | is the 1 norm of x.

3.  If we use the exact evolvability matrix for M, then this does not take into account the likelihood of sampling phenotypes.
    Perhaps using the sampling approximation evolvability matrix would take this into accoumt.
