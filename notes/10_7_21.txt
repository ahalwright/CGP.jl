Tasks for today:
1.  Get run_geno_complexity() to compute complexity.  See data/notes 9_10_21, 9_30_21
    fgrep -R -i geno_complexity */*.jl
2.  See if count_outputs() can compute complexity.
3.  Revise writeup on adaptive evolvability.
4.  Organize results on evolvability approximation.


Longer-term idea:
  Change a phenotype from a bit string to a real-valued vector over bits.
  Add a "weight" to genotypes so that when genotype is executed, result is a weighted phenotype
      which can be combined/averaged with an existing phenotype during evolution.

10_7_21:
Modified evaluate_node() for InteriorNode to restore the use of caching so that complexity, 
    degeneracy, etc. are computed.

Modified count_outputs_parallel() in RecordOutputs to add a keyword output_complex so that 
   outlist is a list of pairs (count,complexity).
