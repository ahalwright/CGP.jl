All diary topics:

9/26:  outdated on effects of mutation on complexity.  Examples of get_bits(). Examples of high/low complexity: test_complexity()
9/27:  gb_complexity meaningless.
9/28:  Tried to understand integration version of complexity.
9/30:  build_all_genes()
10/2:  build_all_genes() didn't work 
         semi_log scatter plot of counts 
10/5:  Rewrote run_geno_robustness() and run_geno_complexity() in Evolvability.jl  Excel plots.
10/6:  run_geno_pheno_evolution() in Genotype_phenotype.jl computes genotypic robustnes and evolvability.
10/8:  Corrected geno_robust() and geno_complexity() in Evolvability.  Scatter plots complexity/evolvability/robustness.
10/9:  Evolvability, complexity, robustness plots for Macia gate set.  Count results for Macia gate set.
        Catalan 2018 claims:  rare phenotypes will not play a central role in evolution: 
          they are hard to find in a genotype space that is filled with abundant phenotypes [12,14,37]." 
10/11: Scatter plots of evolvability, robustness, complexity including some 4x2 results
        A redo of some counts file results to correct ints11_8 and ints11_5.
10/12: Wrote random_neutral_walk() and run_random_neutral_walk() in evovability.jl.  Bugs remain.
10/13: Fixed problem with runs of random_neutral_walk() and geno_complexity()
10/14: Parallelized geno_complexity() in Evolvability.jl
10/15: Evolvability running for 64000 steps for a common and a rare goal.
10/18: Determine bias as defined by Greenbury (2014).
        Goal freq vs goal rank.
10/19: Scatter plot of counts including 8_5, 11_5, 11_8.
10/20: Integrated estimates of phenotypic evolvability in run_geno_complexity() and geno_compexity() in Evolvability.jl.
        Have mostly abandoned this approach.
10/22: Smoothness of complexity landscape.  neighbor_complexity() in src/neighbor_complexity.jl
10/23: No results.  See 10/26
10/26: Objective:  Find the size of the components of the neutral network of a goal by joining components
        discovered on multiple neutral walks.  Very successful for 3x1 goals, some results for 4x1 8_5, failure for 11_8
10/27: Part 1: relate complexity, frequency, steps or log_steps (difficulty of evolution) Scatter plots
        functions geno_complexity() in Evolvability.jl.  cce/Complexity_frequency_difficulty_evolution10_30.docx
        Include plots generated on 12/4 with a larger sample of goals.
       Part 2:  neutral_walk_complexity() in neutral_walk_connectivity.jl: distribution of complexities on a neutral walk.
10/30: Additional results for 10/27
10/31: Distribution of complexities for a list of goals
11/1:  Distribution of complexities for a list of goals (same as 10_31)
11/4:  Arrow of complexity
11/5:  Working on the document "Exploring complexity11_5.docx".
        Checking whether the values of cumm_unique_goals of over 500 in explore_complexity11_4D.csv are plausible.
11/7:  Idea for visualization of a random collection goals.  
       Redoing the counts file for the Raman 4x1 case.
11/10: Kolmogorov complexity (see 11/11 for details)
11/11: Kolmogorov complexity for a set of random goals and for all 2^16 4x1 goals (F files).
11/15: Compute evolvability for a common and rare goal by sampling 65536 circuits.
11/18: Generating plots of evolvability vs robustness with other parameter settings.
11_21: Plot of number of unique phenotypes in a cumulatively increasing sample size of 1-mutant neighbors of the given phenotype.
      Best current idea for explaining the negative relationship between evolvability and robustness:
      Plot of both genotype and phenotype evolvability vs. robustness.
11_22: Attempted to determine connectivity of neutral net of a goal g by finding a distance reducing path from chromosome c1.  
      Not very successful.
11_27:  Includes plot of evo_count for 3 goals and many steps.  Shows that evolvability of common goals eventually catches up with
           evolvability of rare goals.
11_28:  sampling.jl  tests my hypothesis on sampling black, white, blue balls.
11_29:  tests whether increasing gates will effect evolvability vs robustness relationship.
12_1:   New version of neutral_walk_connectivity.jl.  Determining components by intersection neutral walks.
12_4:   Generated 10 plots for all combinations of evo_count, robustness, complexity, frequency, difficulty of evolution  
        See 10_27 for these new plots.
        Rerunnng determining evolvability by repeated sampling for a large number of goals including new goal [0x6b18]
