New code in src/Presample.jl  src/ShapeSpace.jl
See notes/6_14_22.txt for ShapeSpace.jl
Comment:  Presample did not work because it was using random sampling instead of sampling by evolution. 

# Goal for src/ShapeSpace.jl
# Test the extent to which the shape space covering property is true for circuits.

# Goal for src/Psample.jl
# Goal:  Evolve genotypes to map to a given target phenotype where this is difficult, such as 5 inputs.
# Method:  Build a random pre-sample of genotype-phenotype pairs by sampling genotypes and computing their phenotypes.
# Choose a subset of the pre-sample whose phenotypes are close to the target phenotype, and start epochal evolutions from this subset.    

Run with:  
xps with nprocs() = 9
psample_size = 50000
num_evolves=200
max_steps = 300000
rph = UInt32[0x51091e20]  # Chosen based on data/4_22_22/geno_complexity4_22_22C.csv.  Chosen for high number of steps.
p = Parameters(1, 4, 0.05, 0.0, 5, 1, 2, 24, 12)
funcs
4-element Vector{Func}:
 Func(&, 2, "AND")
 Func(|, 2, "OR")
 Func(Main.CGP.Nand, 2, "NAND")
 Func(Main.CGP.Nor, 2, "NOR")
pse = psample_evolve( p, funcs, rph, psample_size, num_evolves, max_steps ); 
findall(x->x<max_steps,map(y->y[2],pse))
30-element Vector{Int64}: 
rlist = run_neutral_evol(p,funcs,rph,num_evolves,max_steps)
findall(x->x<max_steps,map(y->y[2],rlist))
21-element Vector{Int64}:

Thus, psample_evolve() is better than run_neutral_evol(), but maybe not significantly.
