Revised test_reduce_numactive() in evolve_reduce_numactive.jl to report minimum as well as mean
    because this is a better comparison to the computation of kolmogorov compexity in Complexity.jl.
Also reduced the number of trials used in the computation of kolmogorov complexity to 1/4 of
    the number or trials used to compute numactive (which now computes number of active gates).
    Now starting with 3x1 circuits (giving 4x2 circuits), results seem to be much more equal 
    between the two methods.

Modified test_reduce_numactive() in evolve_reduce_numactive.jl to choose random goals instead of random chromosomes.

Rerun all runs in data/5_15
