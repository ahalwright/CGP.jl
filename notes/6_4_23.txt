Conclusion:  
For 8 gates, a strong negative relationship between genotype evolvability and log frequency.
For  gates, a strong negative relationship between genotype evolvability and log frequency.

Conclusion:  
For 8 gates, a strong negative relationship between genotype evolvability and robustness.
For 14 gates, a strong negative relationship between genotype evolvability and robustness.
    Ahnert:  "Comparisons of the genotypic robustness and evolvability therefore consistently show a 
      negative correlation between the two, as observed in regulatory network GP maps [2], RNA [22,52] 
      and Polyominoes [22]." sect 8.4 page 8.
    Manrubia: "Some of the commonalities documented are ... a negative correlation between genotypic evolvability and genotypic robustness" sect 4, p65 

=========================
What Cheyenne should do next:

What are the alternative actions from here:

1)  Continue current adjunct teaching.  Do not be involved with the CS department.  
    Do not prepare to apply for a future lecturer position.  Do not file discrimination lawsuit.
2)  Ask to teach CSCI 150 in preparation to apply for a future lecturer position.  Be somewhat 
    personally involved with the CS department.  Do not file discrimination lawsuit.
3)  File discrimination lawsuit.  Then you must assume your adjunct teaching with the CS department is finished.
    I do not see that this will reduce discrimination in the future---rather I think it will increase it.
    Jesse and others will be even more inclined to avoid any applicant who shows any indication of filing a discrimination lawsuit.
    And you will also likely destroy my relationship with the CS department.
