My hypothesis on the transition away from Henrich's "The secret of our success" to a more modern point of view.

From my email to Cheyenne on 10/26/23:

I have been reading Joe Henrich's book "The secret of our success".  He claims that the ability of a group 
to adapt is due to the ability of the group to develop an adaptive culture.  He claims that the development 
of cumulative culture was "crossing the Rubicon".  His examples are relatively primitive cultures.  
It would be interesting to discuss how this idea relates to less primitive cultures.  

When a transformative technological innovation happens, a group's ability to react cannot be fully
specified by previous culture.  (This could be the definition of "transformative".)  Thus, the group
is driven to experiment with the innovation, and this can drive further innovation and a change of
culture.

Potential examples:

Agriculture

Domestication of animals.

Domestication of the horse.

Invention of the wheel.

Printing press.
