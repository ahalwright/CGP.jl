Discovered that reordering the context did not change the outputs of execute_chromosome() and output_values().
This is due to the caching that is built into evaluate_node().  When I comment out caching for both interior
and input nodes, the results change with order.

using Permutations
p = Parameters(3,1,4,3)
chi = random_chromosome(p,funcs) 
perms = permutations(collect(1:p.numinputs)) 
for p in perms
  println("p: ",p); println(ctx[p],"  ",execute_chromosome(chi,ctx[p]))
end 

Since there is no caching for CompositionalCircuits, changing the inputs of a CompositionalCircuit
does change the output.
