Revised functions in src/LinChromsome.jl to use a parameter argument
in addition to the numregister and numinputs arguments.  

Updated test/testLinChromosome.jl to test these new version, and found
some problems with other function.

neutral_evolution() in Evolve.jl now works with both LinCircuits and
with Chromosomes.
