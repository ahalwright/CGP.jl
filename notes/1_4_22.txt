Extending find_neutral_components() to LinCircuits.
Data are in data/1_3_22/.  Revised run*.jl files to give CSV files and JLD files more meaningful names.
Revised Fnc.jl to always use funcs when calling output_values().

The parameter settings p=Parameters(3,1,4,1) with both 4 funcs and 5 funcs give interesting results.
Example on surt2:
data/1_3_22/neutral_components_lc_0x0b_5funcs_3_4_1_E.csv ran in 175 seconds
Many NC lengths ranging from 4 to 4208.
However, trends toward increasing robustness decreasing complexity with NC length are weak (especially the latter).

Another surt2 example:
neutral_components_lc_0xf5_5funcs_3_4_1_F.csv   5485 seconds
NC sizes:s 1,3,6,8,,10,464,736,9024,10048,115600,139776
Again, robustness and complexity trends are weak at best.
