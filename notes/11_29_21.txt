See cce/random_walk_phnet_evolution_evolvability11_29_21.docx for comparison of evolvability methods 
and hypothesis that epochal evolution can evolve complex goals without being trapped in local optima.

Epochal evolution is a form of hill climbing.  It seems remarkable that one can use mostly neutral 
hill-climbing starting with random genotypes to evolve the most complex phenotypes.  But this is the 
case for 4-input 1-output phenotypes.  For 4000 random phenotypes, I did up to 64 epochal evolutions 
with 11 gates and 8 levelsback, and for all but one of these phenotypes, there was at least 1 successful 
evolution of a genotype that maps to the phenotype.

This raises the question of the reason for the unsuccessful evolutions.  It might be because there are 
multiple connected components of the genotype network of the complex phenotypes, or it might be just 
that extensive neutral exploration is necessary to find the hill climbing path to a genotype that maps 
to the phenotype.

I also did runs with 5-input 1-output phenotypes with up to 1,000,000 evolutionary steps per evolution, 
15 gates, 8 levelsback.  For 100 random phenotypes, there were 32 phenotypes where all 64 of the evolutions 
failed.
