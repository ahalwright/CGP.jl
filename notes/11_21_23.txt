At this juncture, it is sufficient to think of the physical complexity of a sequence as 
the amount of information that is coded in the genomes of an adapting population, about 
the environment to which it is adapting. 

Tentatively, the environment is the GP map.  The GP map is a sequnce of phenotypes indexed 
by genotypes.  

Adami's population is a population of N genotypes.

Let P be the number of phenotypes, and let G be the number of genotypes.  
Thus, the sequence length is G and the alphabet size is P.

Thus, the entropy of an unspecified GP map is:

H(GP) = - \sum_{i=1}^G (1/P) log (1/P) = G 1/P log P 

Specifying the GP map is like selection in the paper.  Thus, the GP map is E, the environment.

Thus, specifying the phenotype of one genotype will reduce the entropy by 1/P log P.

Specifying that the phenotype of a genotype has a K complexity of at least k says that
the phenotype is selected from those phenotypes whose K complexity is at least k.
Let Q be the number of such phenotypes.  Thus, the entropy for this genotype will be 
reduced to 1/Q log Q.
