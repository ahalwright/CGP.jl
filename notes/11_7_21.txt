Comparing LinearGP and CartesianGP results.

Run csvs in lruns10_30_21.csv and in cruns11_7_21.csv in data/correlation_csvs/
Some change in labeling CC --> CR in 

LinearGP plots in data/10_29_21.
CartesianGP plots in data/11_7_21.

Note that some errors with CRecmplx markers and fatal errors with CRscmplx markers.

phnet (pevolv) comparisons
LC:  'LCeevolv vs LCpevolv2 markers LCecmplx 3x1 8_2.png'
Linear positive relationship with some outliers above line and more extreme outliers with large eevolve and samll pevolv
CR:  'CReevolv2 vs CRpevolv1 markers CRecmplx 3x1 8_5.png'  5 errors
Linear positive relationship with some outliers above line and two extreme outliers (0x0069 and 0x0096)
    with somewhat large eevolve and samll pevolv and highest complexity
LC:  'LCeevolv vs LCpevolv2 markers LClsteps 3x1 8_2.png'
CR:  'CReevolv2 vs CRpevolv1 markers CRlsteps 3x1 8_5.png'  same 5 errors
LC:  '10_7_21/LCpevolv1 vs LCpevolv2 markers LClsteps 3x1 8_2.png
CR:  '11_7_21/CReevolv2 vs CRpevolv2 markers CRlsteps 3x1 8_5.png'
Both show a positive relationship with outliers of high number of steps above and to the left of the trend.
