Found that evolution evolvability is not included in the Overleaf version of the UP paper.

And it doesn't appear to be in the saved versions in evotech/pheno_network/universal_properties/tex/

Crucial plots are in data/10_8_22 including lgredund_vs_evolQ_and_samplingD_evolvability3x1_8gts4lb4funcs.png

Code is in src/evolvable_evolvability.jl.  Notes are in notes/10_8_22.txt.

Relevant notes.

5_17_23.txt   Explaining why evolution evolvability is greater than sampling evolvability for rare phenotypes.

Two ideas:

Evolvability can be approximated for 4-input phenotypes using evolution evolvability.  Do this for some example phenotypes.
Compare to redundancy and maybe K complexity.

Does the evolvability of a starting phenotype positively relate to the number of steps needed to evolve a random phenotype from the starting genotype?
