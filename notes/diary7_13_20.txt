An emphasis of the Miller papers is on obtaining a minimum number active circuit that satisfies the goal(s).


Idea:  After evolving circuits to optimum fitness then evolve to minimize number active using neutral evolution.
This is implemented in function mut_reduce_evolve() in src/Evolve.jl and in test/test_reduce_numactive.jl.
A definite conclusion is that starting with a higher value for numinteriors gives more instances of minimum
numactive for the evoltuion of a 3-bit multiplier circuit.  See data/7_13/count_min_2bitmult.txt.
This suggest that random exploration of the neutral network of fitness optimal circuits, perhaps interspesed 
with a small amount of evolution to minimize numactive would be a beter strategy.

It does not appear that minimizing for numactive works better than just evolving ciruits.

Idea:  To solve a difficult problem like the evolution of the 3-bit multiplier, evolve each output
separately, and then combine by building a circuit that combines these solutions by connecting each to
the appropriate inputs and outputs, and then evolving to minimize numactive.  However, the difficulties
described above on minimizing numactive does not suggest that this is a good strategy except perhaps for
very difficult problems.  

Idea:  To evolve difficult multi-component goals, evolve components in order of descreasing difficulty.
I. e., evolve the most difficult component first, the next most difficult next, etc.
