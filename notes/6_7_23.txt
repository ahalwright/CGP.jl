Comments on changes to complexity paper.

Current results:
1)  Redundancy
2)  Redundancy and complexity
3)  Mutation from high to low complexity
4)  Evolution from high to low complexity
5)  Navigability in large genotype/phenotype networks 

Question: Is the evolution of increasing complexity the main "purpose" of the paper?

Question: Should we also include mutation/evolution from high to low redundancy?

Question: How much coverage of theoretical circuit complexity?  Should review Dingle results.

Possible conclusion:  Complex innovation is easy given either biological evolutionary pop sizes and time scales, 
  or cultural human innovation.  Wagner Sleeping Beauties book.  But most such innovations will die because
  the conditions are not right.  Thus, for the circuit model, strong selection is necessary.
  However, maybe complex innovation must happen in incremental steps.
  Do these incremental steps have persist enough to reproduce?
