I have essentially abandoned or at least postponed the LaBar Adami replication effort.

I added the insert_gates!() and delete_gates!() to explore_complexity() and run_explore_complexity()
in Complexity.jl.  The code for insert_gates!() and delete_gates!() is in Chromosome.jl.
I also modified mutate_chromosome!() in Chromosome.jl.

I added insert_gate_prob and delete_gate_prob as keywords to mut_evolve() and neutral_evolution()
in Evolve.jl.

New results are in data/3_12/   (modified from data/1_4/)..
