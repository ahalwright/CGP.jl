Hypotheses:
(1)  Does higher phenotype evolvability correlate with fewer epochal evolution steps to start from phenotype to evolve other phenotypes?

(2)  Does higher phenotype evolvability correlate with fewer epochal evolution steps to evolve the given phenotype to evolve other phenotypes?

For hypothesis (1):
See notes/1_1_24.txt for details on from_evolve() in Evolve.jl.

Can use from_evolve() to find the number of epochal evolution steps to evolve other phenotypes from the given phenotype.
However, function needs to be rewritten to be efficient for all phenotypes.

True exact degree evolvability appears to be maximum even for 6 gates, 4 lb, XOR

Alternative:  Use strength evolvability instead.  data/3_14_23/

For hypothesis (2):

data/11_15_22/  has results on mean_steps plus Kcomp, robustness, lg_redund
data/3_14_23/  has results on degree, strength, and total evolvability

Thus, we can make a scatter plot from these two sources.

Try this for 6 gates, 4 lb, with XOR.

julia> mdf = include("../data/11_15_22/run_ph_evolveM.jl")  # for 6 gates, 4 lb, XOR.  Could only run with nprocs()==1.
julia> mean(mdf.mean_steps) #  556.635546875
julia> findmax(mdf.mean_steps)  #  (6173.0, 125)  # an outlier
julia> findmax(mdf.median_steps) # (1334.0, 135)
julia> udf6 = read_dataframe("../data/3_14_23/phnet_matrix3_14_23U.csv")

julia> scatter(mdf.median_steps, map(lg10,udf6.s_evolvability),smooth=true)
julia> scatter!(ylabel="log strength evolvability",xlabel="median evolve steps",title="3 inputs 6 gates 4 levelsback with XOR")
julia> savefig("../data/1_8_24/lg_strengh_evo_vs_median_steps_3_inputs6gts4lb_XOR.png")
# Plot shows a concave up curve with a strong negative correlation
# Hypothesis 2 is confirmed.
