Removed random_neutral_walk functions from Evolvability.jl since they were duplicated in
random_neutral_walk.jl


All but one of the test functions in CGP.jl/runtests.jl now run, but many do not do any test.

Summary of the "walk" functions in src:

random_walk.jl  
# Calculates robustness and evolvability for all phenotypes by sampling circuits as in Hu et al. (2020). 
# Notes:  1_2.txt, 1_3.txt
  run_random_walks_parallel()
  run_random_walks()
  random_walk()  # outputs a node-edge adjacency matrix or a dictionary.
  # Calculates robustness and degree evolvability for each goal and saves these in a dataframe.
  robust_evolvability()
  robust_evo()
  triangularize!()
  matrix_to_dict()
  dict_to_matrix()
  pairs_to_dict()
  robust_evolvability_to_df() # Run robust_evolvability and then write to csvfile
  # Computes frequency, robustess, strength_evolvability, degree_evolvabilty of a list of MyInts (interpreted as goals)
  dict_to_evolvability() 

random_neutral_walk.jl
# Notes:  diary10_13.txt  
# Results compare with geno_complexity() in Evolvability.jl
