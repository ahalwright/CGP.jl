Languages:
Unclear.  But clearly Banaugh used FORTRAN (and possibly BASIC) and Manlove used COBOL.  Much later, I used Pascal and Lisp.

FORTRAN dates to 1958, COBOL to 1959.  Scientific programming was done in FORTRAN and business programming was done in COBOL.

FORTRAN and COBOL are (AOT) compiled.  In the 1980s and before, this meant that you first compiled your program.  You would
be notified of syntax errors.  In some cases you would load the program, and then run it.  Loading would link your program
with libraries.
