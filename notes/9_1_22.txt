Evolvabilty topics:

* K complexity
  > relationship to redundancy
  > relationship Tononi complexith
* Problems with Wagner 2008, evolvability in both directions
* Total evolvability:  see definition in evolvable_evolvability.jl
* Relationship to K complexity
* Evolution vs. sampling evolvability
* Mathematical definition of evolvavility, entropy evolvability

Fixed kolmogorov_complexity_dict() and redundancy_dict()
