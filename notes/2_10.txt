Ideas on evolvability.

First revisit my discovery that almost all phenotypes have near maximum evolvability.

See Figure 8 of Paper_preview_1_3_21.docx and 
data/1_2/robust_evo_by_walks1_1X.csv  for X = A, B, C.  See notes/1_2.txt for procedure.

See Figures 22, 23, and 24 of Paper_preview_1_3_21.docx 
Figure 22:  from 12/7
Figure 23:  from 12/6 or 12/7

Second, compute evolvability by following a random walk.

Third, compute evolvability by exploring all mutations up to some limit.
