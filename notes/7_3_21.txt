Found that counting unique circuits in evo_dict.jl wasn't working with my method of using an 
immutable Chromosome as a hash key.  So I went to my already programmed circuit_int() function
in the cartesian==true case, and this seems to work correctly.  The cartesian==false case
does not work because mutata_all() is not definined in LinCircuit.jl, and
it looks like the definition of circuit_int() in LinCircuit.jl overrides the definition in Chromosome.jl
(so I turned off the export in LinCircuit.jl).
