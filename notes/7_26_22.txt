Trying to investigate how Tononi complexity scales with numints.
Code:  function tononi_complexity_multiple_params() in Complexity.jl
Data:  data/7_26_22
Computes mean and standard deviation of a collection of ciruits evolved to the phenotypes in goallist.
Results:  T complexity grows with numints.
Starting with suffix F, introduced "normalize" keyword option which divides computed T complexity by numints-1.
Results:  normalizing T complexity did not reduce T complexity to a constant because the average value of 
  mutual information kept increasing (separate experiments with cmplx6() from cmplx5.jl).
  This suggests the conjecture that T complexity will level out when numints gets large enough.
  Mutual information is limited when numinputs is fixed.
  The run with suffix H at least somewhat confirms this hypothesis with the values of T complexity
  increasing only slightly from numints=18 to numints=20.

plot(collect(6:2:20),map(i->Vector(df[i,3:10]),1:5),labels=reshape(map(i->@sprintf("0x%04x",df[i,1][1]),1:5),(1,5)))
plot!(legend=:bottomright,xticks = collect(6:2:20) )
