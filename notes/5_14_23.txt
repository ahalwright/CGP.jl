Comments and TODOs on evolvability paper.

* Either add supplementary information document to current document or make it available to Wolfgang and Ting.

* Abstract:  Mentions epochal evolution but not evolvability results.

* We defined the degree of a node in the phenotype network to include the self edges.  
  Should we mention the existence of network nodes with no self edges?

* Introduction: Robustness and Evolvability.
  = I decided to drop any mention of neutral components.  For the examples where the exact matrix
    is computable, these are significant.  But for the examples of the rest of the paper, it appears
    that the probability that a random genotype ends up in a small neutral component is small.
    This probability is reduced as the number of gates increases.  Maybe we need to do more explanation
    of increasing the number of gates.
  = Paragraph 3:  If mutations to any of the genotypes that map to a phenotype are considered, then
    many more novel phenotypes will be found than by just looking at mutations of a single genotype.

* Including an example of an exact phenotype network is confusing because such an example must 
  have a very limited number of gates and levelsback.  Thus, these results are not typical of the
  results of the rest of the paper where the number of gates is larger.

* What are the effects of increasing the number of gates for a given number of inputs?
  = Increases relative redundancy of most phenotypes while decreasing the redundancy of the most frequent.
    Figure 3 (and Figure 4 although not as obvious).
  = Increases robustness.  Figure 4.
  = Decreases mean evolutionary steps.  Might be a replacement for Figure 13.
    Table 5 strongly shows this.
  = Genotype evolvability.  increases with increasing number of gates.  See notes/5_16_23.txt
  = Phenotype sampling evolvability:  Mean for data/1_3/robust_evo_by_walks1_3D.csv:  107.24
    Mean for /data/1_3/robust_evo_by_walks1_3U.csv  143.37
    Results for Figure 9 are based on suffix D.  Could redo for 10 or 12 gates.

    qdf = read_dataframe("../data/7_8_22/evolvable_evolvabilityCGP_3x1_8_4_7_8_22Q.csv")    # 8 gates 4 lb

Increasing the number of gates increases all kinds of evolvability and thus enhances exploration.
This is supported by the third item (evolutionary steps) above.
The punctuated equilibrium model says that periods of exploration and intersperced with with breakthrough
innovations.  Using a larger number of gates enables the discovery of increased Kolmogorov complexity.

The navigability section demonstrates this.  In this section, we use a larger number of gates and the strong
selection of epochal evolution to solve difficult optimization problems.

Stabilizing selection is needed during exploration to filter out deleterious mutations.  However, 
nearly neutral mutations may help exploration.

If number gates is small: 
  = can enumerate all genotypes for 2 and 3 inputs
  = may be possible to compute exact phenotype network for 2 and 3 inputs 
  = high likelihood of a random genotype being in a small neutral component
  = some phenotypes may have zero redundancy
  = mean evolutionary steps is high
  = phenotypes have low robustness
  = phenotypes have low genotype and phenotype evolvability---see notes/5_16_23.txt and 5_17_23.txt

If number gates is large: 
  = vast number of genotypes
  = neutral components are almost never an issue
  = most phenotypes have moderate redundancy (whatever this means)
  = mean evolutionary steps is reduced
  = phenotypes have both higher robustness and higher evolvability

* A possilbe high-level conclusion:  Sampling properties of our G-P map tend to agree with exact properties,
  while properties based on epochal evolution do not.

* Another tentative conclusion:  given a phenotype there is no difference between the genotypes sampled
  to map to the phenotype and the genotypes epochal evolved to map to the phenotype.  See notes/5_17_23.txt
  for partial confirmation.

Neutral corrlations: (based on Greenbury et al. 2016).

* We can verify a specific version of the neutral correlations univeral property by adding the null model
  plot to our robustness vs. log redundancy plot as in Figure 2a of the Greenbury genetic correlations (2016) paper.
  Null model robustness of a phenotype $p$ is $\rho_p = f_p$.

  "One way of characterising these neutral correlations is by comparing the phenotype robustness ρp to the random 
  expectation $\rho_p = f_p$. The violation of this equality is a sufficient (though not necessary) condition for 
  the existence of neutral correlations. Moreover, we define a phenotype p to have positive neutral correlations if 
  $\rho_p > f_p$ is satisfied. This is intuitive—when robustness is greater than fp then phenotypes are closer to 
  each other in the genotype network than would be expected by random chance."  (page 8)
