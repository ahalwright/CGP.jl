Most essential results:

Explain G-P map.  Set levelsback to maximum possible.

Tononi vs. K complexity  ---- maybe just refer to GPTP paper

log redundancy vs K complexity  Note:  GECCO does log redund vs T complexity

K complexity vs neighbor K complexity (GPTP does for T complexity)
  Perhaps do a heat plot.

review of Dingle's complexity results

mutation from low complexity to high complexity

evolution from low complexity to high complexity

evolution and sampling evolvability vs K complexity

Navibability section explained by complexity:  can use different numbers of gates and max levelsback

Needed:

Logic gate circuit:  Can use a different example

Maybe use strength evolvability instead of degree evolvability

============================

Full Outline

Introduction

  Genotypes and phenotypes
    Includes logic gate circuits
      New example circuit
      No levelsback parameter
      Perhaps 4 inputs for all results (except navigability)
 
  Kolmogorov and Tononi complexity 
    Refer to GPTP for T complexity explanation
  
  Neutral and epochal evolution
    Used to approximate K complexity
  
  Robustness and evolvability
    Use definitions other than pheno network
  
  Summarize universal properties 
    refer to evolvability paper

Methods

  Details of neutral and epochal evolution

  Approximation of K complexity

  Mutation and evolution from low to high complexity

  Sampling (don't need random-walk sampling)

  Approximation of evolvability (evolution and sampling)

Results

  Log redundancy versus rank:  
    Different parameters but same basic plot

  Log redundancy versus K complexity

  Robustness vs K complexity

  Evolution and sampling evolvability vs K complexity

  Mutation from low complexity to high complexity

  Evolution from low complexity to high complexity


  Navigability 
    Different parameters 
    Explain why almost every evolution is fron low to high complexity
