Revised Pop_evolve.jl so that each evolution is to a list of goals rather than a single goal.
The idea is that a large population will be "consolidated" by selection into a smaller region
of the search space while multiple small populations will be able to do more exploration.
Probably we will need to report on the variation of the multiple solutions returned by 
the small populations.

And eventually we will need a migration or horizontal transfer between small populations..
