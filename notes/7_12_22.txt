Plan:  Redo the common_to_rare, rare_to_common, rare_to_rare, common_to_common results in data/7_8_22
based on K (Kolmogorov) complexity rather than on redundancy.

K complexity values for all 3x1 phenotypes are in k_complexity7_11_22C.csv and k_complexity7_11_22D.csv
where the D file just increased max_goal_tries from 10 to 20 and max_ev_steps from 50000 to 100000.  The 
K complexity values are the same suggesting that they are the "true" values.

We discovered that there are 18 high K complexity (K complexity = 6) phenotypes and 18 low K complexity
(K complexity 1) phenotypes.

So the objective is to define "rare" and "common" phenotypes based on K complexity rather than redundancy.
These could be renamed as "high cmplx" and "low complx".
Rare phenotypes will be those with K complexity 6.  Common phenotypes will be those with K complexity 1 or 2---
we should try both.  The problem with using 2 is that there will be too many common phenotypes to display 
in matrices.

Follow the procedure given in notes/7_9_22.txt. You will also want to insert a "kcomplexity" columm 
from the dataframe ../data/7_11/22/k_complexity7_11_22D.csv.

We want to recompute the results in data/7_8_22.  Note that the evolvability results in
../data/7_8_22/evolvable_evolability_3x1_7_4chP.csv do not have to be recomputed.


New results should go in data/7_12_22.
