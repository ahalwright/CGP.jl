Redoing sampling complexities.  I found that I had already done this
and I have spent time redoing what I had already done.
The older method that works is to specify output_complex=true when calling
count_outputs_parallel.  This technique is applied in data/5_16_22.
Cleanup of function build_dataframe() in RecordOutputs.jl:  Commented out all but one version.
Data and results in data/5_16_22/.
