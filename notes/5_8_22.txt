Debugged complex_evolution.jl.  
Purpose:  test the Zenil hypothesis that choosing mutations that increase complexity will speed up evolution.

Problem:  the function default_funcs() sets the global variable Ones which is used in count_outputs().
However, pmap() called test_cmplx_helper() with funcs as an argument.  This meant that default_funcs()
was not called on processors other than the start processor.  So I removed the funcs argument from
test_cmplx_helper() and instead called default_funcs().
