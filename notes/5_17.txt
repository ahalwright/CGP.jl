Clearly run_geno_complexity() was not running right.  It seldom succeeded.

Found that the version of mut_evolve() on pardosa which hadn't recently been updated was
different than that on lycosa.  Did careful comparison testing, and discoverd a bug in
number_mutations() in Chromosome.jl on lycosa.
In Chromosome.jl, change:
    interiors_inputs_list = [ c.interiors[i].inputs for i = 1:length(c.params.numinteriors) ] 
    interiors_inputs_list = [ c.interiors[i].inputs for i = 1:c.params.numinteriors ]
Now, both versions give the same results on simple examples.

Thus, incomplete testing of mutate_chromosome!().

All results since late March that use mutate_chromosome!() need to be redone.
