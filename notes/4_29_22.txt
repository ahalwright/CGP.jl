Figuring out how I created the GECCO plots.

Moved Dropbox/evotech/complexity/data to Dropbox/evotech/CGP.jl/data on Windows to be consistent with Linux.

Revisiting, and modifiying, data/diary/diary11_18.txt.  Successfully reading the appropriate dataframes
and producing the appropriate plots.  Includes an evolvability vs. robustness plot for 5 inputs, 18 gates, 8 lb.

Successfully did 5 gate evolvability vs. robustness vs. complexity plots (all combinations)
Times for 100 phenotypes 74 hours on surt2 28procs, 77 hours on fluda 24 procs.
Plots are in CGP.jl/data/4_22_22/ on Windows
See notes/4_22_22.txt
13lb gave much better results than 9lb.
Note that first run of two pairs was incorrect.  Also, I got errors.

4/30/22:  Checked execution times for computing complexity with 24 gates, 9, 13, 18 lb.
complexity5() is faster than complexity6, complexity7, complexity8, but 
complexity8() gave results inconsistent with the other complexity functions.
Time for complexity5() was about 1 minute and did not seem to vary much with lb,
but did vary with random chromosome.

Rerunning with 15lb and 50 phenotypes on surt2 and fluda.
