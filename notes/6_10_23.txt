Rethinking "purpose" of complexity paper.
Instead of "evolution of increasing complexity", relationship of complexity to other properties of GP map.

Note:  Tononi complexity of a circuit, Kolmogorov complexity of a phenotype.

Complxity Results:
1) Redundancy and complexity
2) Concordance of Tononi and Kolmogorov complexity
2) Mutation from low to high complexity
3) Evolution from low to high complexity
4) Navigability in large genotype networks.  
    Example of strong selection overcoming difficulty of evolution from low to high complexity.
