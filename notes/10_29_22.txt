Trying to sync all data files to an AWS bucket.

aws s3 sync data s3://cgpdata
  # Uploaded all files even they were present in the bucket
  # Maybe the fact that files are in a OneDrive folder messes up synchronization.
aws s3 ls s3://cgpdata --recursive --human-readable --summarize
  Total Objects: 4380
  Total Size: 18.0 GiB

aws s3 website s3://cpgsrc --index-document index.html --error-document error.html
