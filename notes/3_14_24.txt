Neutral components hypotheses:  3/14/24.  Emailed to Cheyenne.

Definition:  A set of genotypes is (path) connected if given any 2 genotypes 
in the set, there is a mutational path of genotypes in the set between the genotypes.

Given a phenotype ph, the neutral set of ph is the set of genotypes that map to ph.
The neutral set is partitioned into a collection of connected components.

Definition:  The relative fraction of components of a phenotype is the is the number 
of components of the neutral set of the phenotype divided by the size of the neutral set.

Hypothesis:  Assume that the number of inputs is fixed.  Then the relative fraction
of components decreases as the number of gates increases.  We could either assume
that the levelback parameter is the number of gates, or is some fixed fraction such
as 1/2 of the number of gates.

Hypothesis:  The relative fraction of conponents is negatively related to random
fitness navigability.

Hypothesis:  The number of epochal evolution steps to find  a genotype that maps 
to a given phenotype increases with the relative fraction of components of the
phenotype.

Note that we already have results (Table 5 of UP paper) that show that random fitness
navigability increases as the number of gates increases.
