Note:  7/30:   Discovered bugs in Evolve.jl and Indiv_evolution.jl that prevented the fault_tol parameter from
being passed to mut_evolve() and next_chromosome(), so all results in this folder are meaningless.

Tests of the hypothesis that increasing fault tolerance increases complexity, degeneracy, and number active nodes.

A flipped gate perturbation of a circuit output is the output of the circuit when the output of that gate is flipped.  The fault tolerance of a circuit is computed by averaging the deviation of the flipped gate perturbation from the unperturbed output over all gates of the ciruit.  This is converted into a fitness by negating and normalizing to a value between 0 and 1.  This is based on equation 3.3 of the Macia and Sole paper.

I have done fairly extensive tests of the above hypothesis both using only NAND gates (as in Macia and Sole) and using the Raman and Wagner function set {AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR}.  These use 3 inputs and 2 outputs for the Macia gate set and 4 inputs and 2 outputs for the Raman gate set.  Despite doing 5000 runs per simulations, I am not getting any significant results.

One interesting result is that running the Macia gate set with 10 gate circuits is much slower than running with 18 gates.  This is consistent with other results.
