Properties of complexity:

Idea:  complexity for digital circuits is analagous to genome length in Avida and perhaps biology.
It is a measure of the amount of information that can be stored in the genome.  This corresponds
Adami's definition of complexity.

Results:

Phenotype complexity measured by sampling and by evolution is equivalent for chromosomes.

Chromosome Complexity is consistently greater and linear as the number of gates increases.
