Ideas on biological adaptation.

An organism is adapted to an environoment if it responds "correctly" for most environmental conditions.
The "correct" response is that which maximizes the organism's likelihood of propagating its genes.

Note that the time scale of this process varies widely.  For a fly evading a predator, the time scale 
is considerably less than 1 second.  For a plant, it might even be months or years.

There are two aspects to this.

One is given an an environmental state (or maybe a preceived environmental state), predicting future
environmental states.  Second is choosing an adaptive (correct) response.

This relates to LLM (large language models).  Think of the environment as the previous text, and the
response as the
