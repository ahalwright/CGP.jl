Trying to write a number_active() function for LinCircuits.

Decided to write a recursive evaluation similar to the one for chromosomes in Execute.jl.
This is easy to test.

Description:  Given an instruction index, for each of the input registers of the instruction,
find the last preceding instruction that sets a value for the register.  If there is such an 
instruction, execute it recursively to get the value of this register.  If not, take the value
from the context.  Use these values to execute the instruction corresponding to the instruction
index, and return the output value of the instruction.

Assumes 1 output.
