Looking at the distribution of Hamming distance changes over the result of mutate_all() with and without XOR.
See the file src/dist_counts.jl and the results in data/11_11_22/.
Conclusion:  Results do not seem to be very related to these results.
Fraction of Hamming distance 1 is considerably less frequent than Hamming distance 2
Robustness of all numinputs are much higher that I expected.  
4 inputs:  0.6 to 0.75
5 inputs:  0.7 to 0.85
Thus, a high fraction of steps are neutral.
