Outline for julia talk at research computing workshop.

1.  How I got started.  Cheyenne Laue and George Lessica

2.  Programming is fun, especially in Julia!!

3.  Interactive (like Python and Lisp)

4.  Fast (like C and Fortran) without any special optimization

5.  Powerful, especially for scientific programming.  Linear algebra and statistics.

6.  Flexible:  multiprocessing---easily uses the resouces of a cluster

7.  Flexible:  multithreading---takes advantage of multiple core processors

8.

Julia is fast because it is JIT compiled.  And all of the code that you are using has been pre-compiled

Julia delivers its swift numerical speed thanks to the reliance on a LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine)-based JIT 
(just-in-time) compiler.  [1]

–such as a superb support for parallelization or practical functional programming
orientation– that were not fully fleshed out when other languages for scientific computation
were developed a few decades ago/  [1]  

Julia is faster and easier to write than Numpy’s vectorized code, and it’s significantly faster than F2PY-wrapped Fortran code.

The key capability in Julia is "you can define methods on types after the type is defined aka "external dispatch" (c.f. external
but static functions).  And this can be done in a separate package which can be loaded or not.  
* generic functions are properly name spaces unlike methods in CBOO.
