Picotech ADC-24 data logger.

Since the data logger has no memory, it looks like the data logger will need to 
be attached to a computer while there is any data logging.  Do you plan to do 
data logging over long periods of time?

I have 3 different Linux computers that could be used for this purpose.  We will 
want to add a Linux compatible wifi adapter so that the computer can be accessed 
remotely---these are cheap.  What is more complicated is to set it up so that I 
can access the computer remotely---assuming that it is in your house.  This 
means reconfiguring your wifi router which I have done for my router.

We might also want to set up the Linux computer with a monitor and keyboard.
I have an unused monitor and keyboard.

Downloaded the picolog software from https://www.picotech.com/downloads (Mac version).
I now have a PicoLab app on my mac.

Plugged the terminal board into the data logger using the 28-pin connector.
The terminal board has connection ports.  

One port is labeled +2v5, and when I connect my multimeter to this port and
AG (analog ground), I read 2.5 V.

Opened the transcutaneous nerve simulator and am understanding what it does.
I deduce that this is what will be used to stimulate the mushrooms.

Sally has "stiff knees"---non-serious pain in her knees when she bicycles.
It occurs to me that we might try this on her knees.

===================
I am running the picolog software on my mac.

ADC-24 KP366/090 is shown as a device.

So far I have not gotten it to log any data.  I apply battery voltages to 
pairs of inputs but nothing shows up.  We may need to meet to try to 
resolve this problem.
