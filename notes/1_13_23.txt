Trying to straighten out Introduction section:

Also: added exact evolvability Q matrix for 3 inputs, 5 gates, 3lb, 5funcs to 9_24_22.txt

List of Introduction subsections: topics covered in each subsection.

End of list of Introduction subsections

Issues: 

  How do we combine the direct approach to evolvability versus phenotype network approach?

  Introduction doesn't cover the second and third main points of the paper given below.

What are the main points of the paper:

  Strengths and weaknesses of methods of approxmating phenotype evolvability, total evolvability

  Probability of mutation from high to low redundancy decreases exponentially with difference in log redundancy

  Evolution from high redundancy to low redundancy succeeds.
