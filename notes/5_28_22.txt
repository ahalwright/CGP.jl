Problem:  did a run of LGP 4x1 10_2 counts by sampling which returned over 50% of phenotypes not found.
Wrote functions count_phenotypes() count_phenotypes_parallel() currently in test_count_outputs.jl (to be moved to RecordOutputs.jl).

Verified that only about 8000 phenotypes not found in a sample of 10^10 genotypes.

Added a "complexity" option so that the function will also compute complexities.  Thus, sampling complexities by genotypes is possible,
but since running with complexity=true very much slows down computation, so maybe only for 3 inputs.
How should genotypes that don't occur be counted?  Probably just skip them.

data/5_26_22/circuit_complexities_LGP_5_26_22B.csv is a good source of complexities by phenotypes.
