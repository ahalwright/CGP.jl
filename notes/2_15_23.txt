Methods for Shape Space covering.

Evolution:

        # for each ph in phlist:
        #   find phenotypes in the num_mutates neighborhood a circuit evolved to map to ph
        #   generates a row of the output dataframe with the properties of this circuit

        mutate_all

  shape_space_fract_successes  # computes the fraction of common phenotypes covered by num_mutates mutations of the given phenotype.

Sampling:
phdf = shape_space_sampling_successes( p, funcs, num_mutates, quantile_values, wdf.circuits_list, goals_list=phlist, csvfile="" )
  shape_space_circuit_ints_list
    shape_space_circuit_ints
      pheno_set_funct  # Recursively compute the set of phenotypes reached by all num_mutates mutations from all circuits in circuit_int_list
        mutate_all

  shape_space_fract_successes

=====================================


Both: A "success" is phenotype produced by mutate_all that is common.  Fract successes is the fraction of common phenotypes covered by phenotypes generate by  mutate_all.

  produce a dataframe with a row for each ph in phlist and a fract_successes column for each quantile value 
  plot these fract_successes values.
