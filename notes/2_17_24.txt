UP paper:  who is our audience?

I have looked at the paper "On the Nature of the Phenotype in Tree Genetic 
Programming" by Wolfgang and Illya Bakurov.  What is important is not the
details, but their approach to genotypes and phenotypes.

Our UP paper is based on papers by Andreas Wagner, Sebastian Ahnert, Ard 
Louis, Sam Greenbury.  These are biologists and biophysicists rather than 
genetic programming specialists, and their approach is quite different.  

We are currently planning to submit to Royal Society Interface which is not 
typically read by evolutionary computation researchers.  However, if 
Wolfgang is a co-author, this will help to have it noticed by genetic 
programming researchers.  

A weakness of our paper from a genetic programming point of view is that
our phenotypes have no practical purpose.  There are real-world problems
of finding circuits to achieve specifications, but our results seem to 
be too small to solve these problems.  Wagner and Raman's paper was oriented
around designing FPGAs, but my impression that current FPGAs are too 
large/complicated for our results to be useful in this context.

Our intended audience seems to be biologists and biophysicists rather 
than genetic programming researchers.  Do we have enough background to make 
the paper interesting to and readable by genetic programming researchers?

In the interest of getting the current paper finished, maybe we should write a 
separate paper whose intended audience is genetic programming researchers?
When we send the paper to Wolfgang and Ting, we could ask for their advice.
