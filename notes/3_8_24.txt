Algorithm for neutral components:

Given a phenotype ph
  From the possible circuit ints for the parameter settings
    Generate a list phl of those that map to ph
      Construct an array pha that maps phl to circuit ints
      For each circuit int chi in phl
        Find the circuit ints of the neutral neighbors of chi
        Map chi to the minimum of these: pha[i] = min( neutral neighbors of chi)
