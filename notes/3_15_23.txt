TODO:

1.  Read introduction 

2.  Reorganize and cut methods section.  Move some parts to supplementary information.

3.  Write up high-level overview of infinite population.

Additional "universal" properties:

1.  the ubiquitous existence of large neutral networks for common phenotypes that span the whole space of genotypes (Manrubia 4.)

2.  Linear growth in phenotypic robustmess with NSS. (Manrubia 4.)  The logarithmic scaling relationship between phenotypic
      robustness and frequency (Ahnert p. 8)
