Update on evolving n-input circuits from previously evolved (n-1)-input circuits.

Given an n-input phenotype ph, we can split it into two (n-1)-input phenotypes by using function extract_odd_even() in Phenotype.jl.
Then we can neutral evolve chromosomes to map to each of these phenotypes and combine these circuits into single circuit.
May need to change inputs to chromosome by increasing each input by 1.  Then do neutral evolution with a specified gate list that
holds the above circuit fixed and evolves a chromosome that maps to ph.  To test:  is this usually easy?
