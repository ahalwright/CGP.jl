Recall that for LinCircuits, 
# When Parameters are used, numinteriors specifies numinstructions.
# When Parameters are used, numlevelsback specifies numregisters.

Question:  Does the actual number of instructions of a LinCircuit lc need to agree with lc.params.numinteriors?
Can we reduce the number of instructions without changing the parameters? 
Can we do remove_inactive() without changing the parameters?
Answer should be yes.
