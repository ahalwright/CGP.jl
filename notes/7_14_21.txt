"The not-so-hidden secret is that biological innovations never come about during the great transition 
they are associated with. Feathers did not arise during the evolution of flight, nor did lungs and 
limbs originate during the transition to land. What’s more, these great revolutions in the history 
of life, and others like them, could never have happened otherwise. Major changes in the history of 
life didn’t have to wait for the simultaneous origin of many inventions. Massive change came about 
by repurposing ancient structures for new uses. Innovations have antecedents that extend deep in time. 
Nothing ever begins when you think it does."

This is relevant to to my concept of adaptive niches.  Lungs and limbs were adaptive niches that
led to the transition to land.  Feathers were adaptive niches that led to the transition of
dinosauers/birds to flight.
