It seems to be that an instruction of a program is neutral iff it is not effective,
  i. e., the output contributes to the output of the program.
  An any mutation to an effective instruction modifies the output. 
  Thus, a mutation is neutral iff it is to an ineffective instruction.

Page 75:  
Fig. 4.3.  These seem to be pictures of genotypes, not phenotypes.
  And later in the page they reference phenotype A and phenotype B.

"These are counteracting tendencies that are
able to explain why evolution in the longer run (when neutrality dominates) prefers
low complexity solutions, while in the shorter run (when fitness effects dominate) it
prefers to access solutions with higher complexity."

Not clear what this means.  Can this statement be empirically verified?

Question 1:  is the neutral set of a phenotype connected?  Is there a path of
neutral mutations between any two genotypes that map to the phenotype?
Consider the case where the number of instructions in the genotype is the
number of instructions set in the parameters.

Question 2:  is it possible adaptive walks to fail?  Is it possible to reach
a genotype (or maybe start at a genotype) where there is no mutational path
to a genotype of the target phenotype?
