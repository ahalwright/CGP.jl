Hypothesis:  Assume a random fitness function. 
From this fitness, define a phenotype to fitness rank function.
If phenotype ph has the second highest fitness, ph maps to 2.

Assume parameters P.  Do many hill climbs starting from random genotypes.
The average fitness rank of the results is a measure of the ruggedness of the landscape.
Thus, as the number of gates increases, the average fitness rank decreases.
