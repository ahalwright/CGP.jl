if we define accessible paths of point mutations between a low fitness phenotype and a high
fitness phenotype as those with monotonically increasing fitness, are such paths sufficiently 
common that they can easily be found by an evolving population?

Our main contribution here is to show that commonly observed structural properties of GP maps greatly increase the
number of accessible paths, or ‘navigability’, in associated fitness landscapes. 

Our findings show that certain structural properties of GP maps give rise to navigable fitness landscapes, and that 
the resulting accessible paths are indeed likely to be exploited in the course of biological evolution.

II results

Except for one result, fitness is assigned randomly from [0,1] to phenotypes except that the target phenotype has fitness 1.

A Several well-studied genotype-phenotype maps induce navigable fitness landscapes

Three example landscapes:
1)  RNA secondary structure
2)  Polynomial
3)  Several HP lattice protein folding maps

Two random phenotypes.  Navigability

< \psi > = 1/N \sum_k^N \psi_{s_k t_k}

over source target pairs where \psi_{ij} = probability that an increasing fitness mutational path exists
from a genotype of i to a genotype of j.

Navigability greater than 0.6 for all but non-compact HP model.

B  Common properties of GP maps are associated with navigability

2 Positive neutral correlations increase navigability
3 Large dimensionality increases navigability and decreases ruggedness
    We measure landscape ruggedness <κ> as the average proportion of all genotypes encountered that are local 
      fitness maxima (no neutral neighbours or neighbours with increased fitness). 
      NOTE: for logic gate G-P map, local fitness maxima are very rare.

C Navigability of functional RNA fitness landscapes

With neutral mutations allowed, navigability is almost always 1.0, suggesting that fitness landscapes with 
    fRNAdb source and targets are highly navigable. 

Where neutral mutations are disallowed, we find that navigability is markedly reduced below 1.0, although still 
substantially greater than zero (< \psi > in [0:38; 0:64]).

D. Evolutionary dynamics make use of accessible paths between fRNAs

We simulated evolutionary dynamics with a Wright-Fisher process, implemented via a genetic algorithm, and 
considered two different fitness assignment schemes: (a) random and (b) using a given phenotype’s 
dot-bracket Hamming distance to the target phenotype

We consider only the polymorphic dynamical regime (NµL ≫ 1, where N is population size, µ is point mutation 
rate and L is genotype length).

III. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

The metaphor of the fitness landscape has endured for almost a century of research in evolutionary biology. It is often
discussed in intuitive terms, as a low-dimensional landscape.  This can be problematic, as it obscures 
counter-intuitive properties of high-dimensional spaces, which real fitness landscapes are. Moreover, much of the 
literature on fitness landscapes does not consider genotype-phenotype maps and their properties, such as the ubiquity 
of neutral networks and their correlations in genotype space. Our contribution demonstrates
that specific GP map properties, in combination with highdimensionality, make fitness landscapes navigable.

Additionally, we demonstrated that the phenotype network is arguably a more useful way to conceptualise 
evolutionary exploration.  Visualising the fitness landscape in this way avoids the misleading intuitions of 
fitness valleys that can arise from the lowdimensional fitness landscape metaphor.

Abstract

The mutational neighbourhood of a genotype in these GP maps is much more likely to contain genotypes 
mapping to the same phenotype than in the random null model. Such neutral correlations can be quantified 
by the robustness to mutations, which can be many orders of magnitude larger than that of the null
model, and crucially, above the critical threshold for the formation of large neutral networks
of mutationally connected genotypes which enhance the capacity for the exploration of
phenotypic novelty. Thus neutral correlations increase evolvability. 

Author Summary

Point mutations are orders of magnitude more likely than expected by random chance to link genotypes that map 
to the same phenotype, which vitally increases the potential for evolutionary innovation by generating
neutral networks. If GP maps were uncorrelated like the random map, evolution may not even be possible. 
We also find correlations for non-neutral mutations: Mutational neighbourhoods are less diverse than expected 
by random chance. Such local heterogeneity slows down the rate at which new phenotypic variation can be found. 
But non-neutral correlations also enhance evolvability by lowering the probability of mutating to a deleterious
non-folding or non-assembling phenotype.

Introduction

We employ a model we call the random GP map. It has the same number of genotypes mapping to each phenotype 
as the biophysical GP map to which it is being compared, as well as the same basic type of genotype space 
(alphabet size and genome length), and nodes (genomes) that are linked by single mutations if they differ by 
one locus. The difference is that the genotypes are randomly distributed across the genotype space. 

Besides their simplicity, an advantage of using the random GP maps for this purpose is that the overall 
connectivity of the genotype space is left intact, along with several global properties of the map, 
allowing the way phenotypes are arranged to be directly considered.

Results

Phenotypic robustness and neutral correlations

Algebraic definition of phenotypic robustness 

\rho_p = 1/F_p \sum_{g in \cal{G}_p} \frac{\eta_{p,g}}{(K-1)L}

\eta_{p,g} is the number of genotypes that are accessible with a 1-poin mutation of g.

K is alphabet size.} \frac{\eta_{p,g}}{(K-1)L}

\eta_{p,g} is the number of genotypes that are accessible with a 1-poin mutation of g.

K is alphabet size.  F_p is neutral set size.

In Fig 2A, we compare the phenotypic robustness across our three biological GP maps 
to the robustness of the associated random GP map. 

Generalised robustness and neutral correlations

Generalised robustness or n-robustness \rho_p^{(n)}, measures phenotypic robustness for a greater 
number of mutations. It is defined as the robustness of a genotype with phenotype p to n 
1independent mutations to its genotype, rather than just the single mutation discussed above.

Figure 2a shows phenotype robustness vs. log redundancy increases linearly.
Figure 2b shows n-robustness vs radius.  Not very interesting.

We also define a neutral correlation length n^* which measures the mutational hamming distance 
over which neutral correlations extend. 

The presence of positive neutral correlations/higher phenotype robustness results in larger 
and fewer neutral components
