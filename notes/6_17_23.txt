Both Lucy and Carlos are excellent candidates.

I favor Carlos Oliver over Lucy Williams.  Both candidates gave excellent teaching talks.
I rate Carlos's research as better than Lucy's.  Even though their citation records are
similar, Carlos's research covers a broader range of research areas and thus I think he
has more potential for funding.  This is primarily due to Carlos's connections to multiple 
well-established research groups.

Also important to me is that there is overlap between
my research (which is joint with Cheyenne) and his, and he has already made suggestions
which will help me with papers that are in-progress.  However, as an interviwing 
candidate it is in his interest to appear interested in the research of those he is
interacting with.

I have some reservations about Carlos not showing up for previous interviews.  An reason
for not showing up was a refusal to get a covid vaccination and a concern for "bodily
integrity".  This might suggest some inflexitbility.  I saw no problems during his interview.
