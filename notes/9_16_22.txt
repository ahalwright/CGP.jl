Finished running data/8_9_22/run_k_complexity4x1N.jl to compute K complexity of 4x1 goals of 5 func goals for phenotypes 0x4000 to 0x7fff.
The CSV file reported using 4 gates and clearly that is what was run.
Comparing k_complexity8_9_22G.csv with k_complexity8_9_22N.csv
diff = gdf.num_gates - ndf.num_gates
findall(x->x!=0,diff)
2003-element Vector{Int64}:
findall(x->abs(x)>1,diff)
9-element Vector{Int64}:

Reset default_funcs() in Func.jl to 5 funcs.
Currently running data/8_9_22/run_k_complexity4x1M.jl for goals 0x0000 to 0x3fff.


Counts of some perhaps enumerable parameter settings:
3x1 6 gates, 3 lb
4 funcs:  
julia> count_circuits_ch(pp,nfuncs=4)
2.176782336e9
5 funcs:  
julia> count_circuits_ch(pp,nfuncs=5)
