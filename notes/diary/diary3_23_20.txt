3/18/20 and after

Worked on Hypothesis 1 proposed in Research update 3_18_20.docx.
Hypothesis 1:  Selecting chromosomes (logic circuits) for mutational robustness will result in 
increasing chromosome complexity as measured by the number of active gates in the chromosome.

As I coded for testing this hypothesis, I realized that mutating inactive genes will of
course not change the result.  So it seems to make sense that selecting for mutational robustness
will select for an increased number of inactive genes which would select for decreasing 
complexity.  Thus, I did not expect tests for this hypothesis to be positive.

So an alternative hypothesis was to measure mutational robustness in terms of mutation
only at active nodes.  I had a number of bugs in my code to test this hypothesis.
I used "julia test/robust_active.jl" to test and correct my code (after uncommenting
print statements in function avg_mutational_robustness of Experments.jl).

My code is in test/runexperiments.jl and src/Experiments.jl

The test involves computing the correlation of mutational_robustness_list and
fract_active_list both of which are indexed over iterations.  For both hypotheses, correlations
are always negative.
