Mutual information

Did a full literature search of papers citing Whitacer 2010 (but not quite finished).
The papers are included in cce/Papers on Degeneracy5_5_20.docx.

Looked at Sherwin 2006 and Dewar 2011 for the orgin of what I am calling Sherwin Mutual
Information.  It looks like Sherwin 2006 did a 2 location 2 allele model which fits both.
Tried with only partial success to verify Sherwin 2006 formulas in test/sherwin_mi.jl.

Worked on functions in Evolve.jl.  Previous version has only exact evolution.

Goal is to write an evolution function that evaluates how many components of 
circuit outputs match the corresponding components of a goal in a goallist.t
Example:

function eval_chromosome() and function chrome_check() seem to work.  
See the comments in Evolve.jl.

I am perhaps part way to writing  function mut_evolve_subgoal() which will do 
single chromosome neutral evolution with an increase in "fitness" when an additional
number of components of the output match components of a goal in goallist.
