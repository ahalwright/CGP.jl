Did a full backup of both lycosa and pardosa files using tar, and saved them to windows 
   oldmtnbiker/evotech/zsave/

Modified (on lycosa) CGP.jl/src/InfTheory.jl so that CGP.jl/test/test_degen_complexity.jl would work. 
Changed all calls to get_probs() in InfTheory.jl to calls to get_bits().  Then test_degen_complexity.jl
works which verifies that my two versions of degeneracy and my two versions of complexity agree.

The tried to test degeneracy and complexity using sherwin_mutual_information, and found that
the two versions of degeneracy work but give different answers.  The simpler version of the 
complexity function (complexity5)  never uses mutual information, and the other version (complexity6)
gives different answers.

Added a keyword argument  mutinf  to these function definitions to be able to choose the
pops_to_tbl() (Sherwin) verion of mutual information.

The reason that the Sherwin version of mutual_information doesn't work is because each population
is a row of the table used to compute mutual information, while for the pops_to_dist() version,
the two populations are used to create a joint distribution.   This allows the formula

  mutual_information(P,Q) = entropy(P) + entropy(Q) - joint_entropy(P,Q)
     = entropy(P) + entropy(Q) - entropy( pops_to_dist(P,Q) )

For the Shersin version, one of P or Q is the row_marginals() and this is just equal probability
for each of the rows.
