A re-implementation of the crucial functions.

Wrote functions neutral_evolution(), geno_circuits(), geno_properties(), geno_list_properties() all Evolve.jl.
neutral_evolution() is a simplified version of mut_evolve().
geno_circuits() computes phenotype evolvability, genotype evolvability, robustness, complexity, steps for
    num_circuits circuits that map to a given goal.
geno_list_properties computes robustness, complexity, genotype evolability, phenotype evolvability, evolutonary steps
    for the goals of gl.  The properties are based on the evoution of num_circuits circuits that map to the goal.
