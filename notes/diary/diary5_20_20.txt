Currently running experiments.
Discovered that the main computational bottleneck is computing degeneracy and sdegeneracy via mutual information.
Complexity is also very slow, but redundancy is OK.
Trying to do current simulation with numints=20 and nreps=100, and it isn't working.
Testing the NAND func versus the Raman func set.  
Evolution always succeded with inputs=2:3, outputs=2:2:6, ngoals=2:4:10. Version E
With inputs=4, outputs=1, evolution was very fast.
However, with inputs=4, outputs=2 or greater, numints=22, evolution was almost never successful even with 1000 or 2000 or 5000 goals.
Specifically, with inputs=4, outputs=2, numints=22, numgoals=8000, only 1 out of 6 was able to achieve 2 goals.  Version G.

Moved 5_20 data and .jl files from data/may2020 to data/5_20.

Possibilities for the next step:
Rewrite Complexity to better describe objectives.
What can I get out of the current simulations?
Parallelize using the technique developed in spatial. Runs with numints=20 are not practical without doing this
Add hamming distance to fitness.
Write options for how to add selection for environmental robustness.
Clean up the two versions of entropy.jl
