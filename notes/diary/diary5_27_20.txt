Finished updating Entropy.jl from entropy.jl using type Unions to reduce duplicate code.
See src/aliases.jl for the new type defintions for Entropy.
See test/test_Entropy.jl for tests of all or almost all functions in Entropy.jl.  These include the
   tests that are in test/test_cover_mutint.jl.
TODO:  Write an overview of the functions in Entropy.jl

Debugged  src/Avg_mut_robustness.jl and test/robust_active.jl.  Used the @time macro to compare
execution time for different values of numints with numinputs=4 and numoutputs=2, 30 iterations
numints     time
15        6.6 sec
18       63.2 sec
20      253.8 sec
Definitely exponential

Plan for adding selection on mutational robustness:

Write a revised version of next_chromosome which chooses the best new chromosome by evaluating 
    lambda new chromosomes based on both Hamming distance and mutational robustness.
    The initial version will be based on higher priority to Hamming distance over mutational
    robustness.
