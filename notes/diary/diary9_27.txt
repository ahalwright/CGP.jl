Discovered that gb_complexity applies get_bits twice and so is meaningless.
It was not significantly correlated with evolvability.

On surt2, tried out NAND only gates with numinputs=4.  
Used 100 reps and 50 goals
15 interiors works OK with one goal very slow.
13 interiors works most of the time.
Both simulations just stopped when down to one process.
Tried both again with 5 reps and 50 goals.

On lycosa, tried out 2 inputs with NAND only gates with 5 interiors.
Hard goals (needed 6 interirors) included 0x6, 0x9, 0xb,
