What is the big picture goal for the UP paper?

An evolving system based on a GP map with the universal properties has both exploration and exploitation.
High robustness implies the neutrality that enables the system to widely explore the neutral set of
the initial genotype for single-individual evolution, or the neutral sets of the genotypes of the current
population of population-based evolution.  Simultaneously, the high evolvability implies that this
exploration will traverse an increasingly diverse set of phenotypes. 

Based on this, I think we should include navigability results because they imply that fitness valleys
are rare and are unlikely to impede evolutionary exploration with the caveat that the neutral evolution
to find high-dimensional bypasses may take a long time or a large population size.  Greenbury's (2022) 
navigability results and my navigability results are based on uncorrelated fitness which means that the 
fitness of a non-neutral mutation is not correlated with the fitness of the mutated genotype.  Greenbury 
claims that correlated fitness increases navigability.  This is where it would be somewhat difficult
to replicate the Greenbury results and I have not done so.

My navigability results are heavily based on the first method of sampling.  

This also argues for including neutral and epochal evolution in the paper.

This would mean adding more to the paper, but this is where my thinking on the "big picture" leads.

Yesterday I claimed that the Fortuna 2017 Avida based paper has some of the universal properties.
I am not sure whether we should include this claim.

Some time ago I changed the Overleaf version to make you the first author of the UP paper.

You were going to send me a current draft.  We are scheduled to meet at 3.

================================================

3 inputs:
md20 = read_dataframe("../data/8_11_23/navigability_3x1_8gts_8_11_23C.csv")
insertcols!(md20, 9, :fails=>map(x->string_to_expression(x)[1],md20.failures)); names(md20)
conv(x) = Vector{Int64}(x)  # Convert from Pooled arrays
scatter(map(x->lg(x),conv(md20.destfreq)),conv(md20.fails),smooth=true,labels="failures vs log frequency")
plot!(xlabel="log frequency",ylabel="failures")
plot!(title="3 inputs 8 gates 20 circuits" )
gui()
savefig("../data/8_11_23/successes_vs_log_freq_3inputs_8gates_20circuits.png")

4 inputs:
The above is not going to work for 4 inputs because of the high failure rate and the limited number of circuit ints
saved in the frequency files (58).  Rerunning seems to take almost a day on surt2.

However, I can give my spreadsheet table in universal_properties/navigability_results_summary.xlsx.
