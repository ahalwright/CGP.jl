The redundancy count for 4 inputs, 14 gates, 7 lb finally finished on surt2 after many days.
File on mac and surt2:  data/8_15_22/count_outputs_ch_5funcs_4inputs_14insts_7regs_L.csv
Copied to file data/counts/count_outputs_ch_5funcs_4inputs_14gates_7lb_L.csv
Revised function redundancy_dict() in Complexity.jl to work for 14 gates 7 lb.

Evolvability in grammatical evolution by Eric Medvet https://doi.org/10.1145/3071178.3071298
    Might be slightly relevant, but grammatical evolution is quite different from CGP.
  I suggest that we do not try to reference grammatical evolution.  If Wolfgang thinks it is 
    important, he will mention it.

Towards Phenotypic Duplication and Inversion in Cartesian Genetic Programming, Roman Kalkreuth
  Very relevant but not in a peer reviewed venu.  Since we don't have time to check correctness, do not reference.

Populations of genetic circuits are unable to find the fittest solution in a multilevel genotype–phenotype map
  by Pablo Catalán, Susanna Manrubia and José A. Cuesta  https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2019.0843 
  Definitely reference this paper.

A Study of Direct and Indirect Encoding in Phenotype-Genotype Relationships by Clyde Meli
  Hard to access and does not look to be very significant.  Do not reference.

Approximate Multipliers Using Bio-Inspired Algorithm by K. K. Senthilkumar
  Not easy to access, and I don't think it is very relevant.  Do not reference.
