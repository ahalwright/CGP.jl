Cooper assignment:

Note that /home/ccraig/evotech/cgp.jl/ on xps contains the OneDrive synced version of my files which are the versions that I am working on.
In particular, /home/ccraig/evotech/cgp.jl/src/neutral_evolution_record.jl is my most recent version.  
   It include good comments including how to do a example run.  
   Be careful about editing these files, becuase they are my "master" versions.
/home/ccraig/evotech/CGP.jl/ includes my latest version that I have pushed to GitHub.
  Modifying these files would be OK but if you edit source files, they will likely be overwritten when I next do a git pull.
  But I normally save changed versions to the src/stash/ subdirectory.

/home/ccraig/evotech/cgp.jl/data/  contains my OneDrive synced version of data directories.  In particular, 
  if you include /home/ccraig/evotech/cgp.jl/data/12_2_22/run_neutral_evolution_recordA.jl  
  it will run neutral_evolution_record and create a datafile in /home/ccraig/evotech/cgp.jl/data/12_2_22
  You can copy this file to run_neutral_evolution_recordB.jl and change the suffix in the file to save the dataframe from another run.
  And of course, you can do B, C, D etc.

Assignment:  Do multiple runs of neutral_evolution_record() as in the comments in neutral_evolution_record.jl.
Try to understand what epochal factors cause long epochs, and what are the changes as epochal evolution proceeds.


Editing src/neutral_evolution_record.jl.

Fixed bug: epochal evolvability, robustness, and log redundancy were all zeros.

Wrote good comments on function neutral_evolution_record() in neutral_evolution_record.jl.
